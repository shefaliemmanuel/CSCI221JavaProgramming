(5:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: dude Michael is asking me when he should tell his partners that they are out of the company after this class is over.....
(5:02 AM) Robert Seidl: What do you think about that?
(5:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he needs to give them time and not jump to conclusions 
(5:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they are passionate about the project just not tech 
(5:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol.... 1) are they slowing him down in a measurable way? 2) is he paying them or something? (if they’re working for free and helping in whatever way they can it sounds like he should be grateful) 3) why is he worried about firings and not project centered concerns? 4) did he provide sound rationale for why it would be better for his project on a short & long term basis. 
(5:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Unless one of those things is clearly not being satisfied, then yes I’d agree with you that he needs to probably dial it down from a 100 to like a 9 lol 
(5:20 AM) Robert Seidl: 5) what responsibilities did he clearly outline for them from the beginning 6) what did he promise / commit to with them? —- did he ask them to be part of his project in an academic sense only?
(5:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 1. no! they just aren’t the best presenters which i’m helping them with- in fact they are the ones getting all the other documents written for the class and setting up meetings and what not 
(5:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 2. no one is getting paid 
(5:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 3. he is worried about project centered concerns, but they were talking about teams who split up before their final presentation VS teams who split up after 
(5:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the final presentation is worth 90% of their grade 
(5:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think that’s why he’s been thinking about it so much
(5:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but it’s become so apparent that he doesn’t care about what one of them says like anytime he has a thought he directly talks to me and doesn’t even look at his partners
(5:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like I would feel horrible if that was me
(5:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 4. nope
(5:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 5. they only have their responsibilities outlined by the class 
(5:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: each of the 3 roles has different deadlines tailored to their major 
(5:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 6. academic only 
(5:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s just general in the first place because you meet when no one has an idea you just see who you vibe with and then form a team
(5:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Would you like my opinion?
(5:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: is that even a question 
(5:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol
(5:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Michael thinks he’s Wyatt fucking Earp at the O.K. Corral.
