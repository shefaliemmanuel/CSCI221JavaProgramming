(1:08 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂😂
(1:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she also wants me to help her at the gym when I help sophia 
(1:09 AM) Robert Seidl: I know so many people that tell me how they want to get into politics.... pretty much none of them would be good. 
(1:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Many of them are the worst 😂😂😂
(1:10 AM) Robert Seidl: Seriously your ego has to be so huge to be what should be a “mature” adult and think you honestly deserve to be running other people’s lives. 
(1:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she wants to do that BUT “she doesn’t want any attention”
(1:13 AM) Robert Seidl: By 19 at the citadel I realized no one deserves to have that power. In addition to my disgust with how it actually works, that realization that no one deserves to be or should be in charge of managing others personal lives (including myself) led me to simply want to get away from people who wanted to run me.  
(1:14 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
(1:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahahaha 
(1:14 AM) Robert Seidl: I really hope you deadpan just said, “that’s a lie.” 😂😂😂😂😂😂

(1:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Normally I resolve to stay out of other peoples relationships at all costs.... but.....
(1:17 AM) Robert Seidl: With her I just might happen to “accidentally” expose solid proof to the boyfriend she was cheating. It’s so fucked up and she’s so utterly disguising that I really feel he deserves to know.... plus he’s in the military. 
(1:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Little gets me more heated than girls that cheat on men while they’re away in the military 
(1:19 AM) Robert Seidl: I would straight up tell her you should break up with him and tell him you’ve been seeing other people. 
(1:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Fuck. Her.

(5:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol like a mini proud 
(5:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was bad, but I could just tell you genuinely were asking me too and didn’t want to 
(5:08 AM) Robert Seidl: Your voice was like a drug to me tonight
(5:08 AM) Robert Seidl: Like molly...
