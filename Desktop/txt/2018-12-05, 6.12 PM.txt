(6:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼Terrabase had the convo
(6:21 PM) Robert Seidl: He’s right to not want to give up any equity, it’s a class project... the idea that the girls would be entitled to equity in his idea, creation, and system would have little to stand on.  Furthermore, even if they did 25% of a class projects work, that in no way would automatically equate to 25% of a  companies value over the long term. The girl’s might have a case for deserving some for if compensation at some point, but that’s probably the extent of it. The problem Michael caused though, is that he clearly mislead them. Which has left them confused and upset. He should have lead them and clearly communicated to them his vision and how he saw them a part of it. But he didn’t, and that’s always how you end up with bitter co-workers, teammates, or employees. 
(6:21 PM) Robert Seidl: *form not “for if”
(6:23 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha Michael has literally no fucking clue about anything let alone a vague concept of startup lifestyle 
(6:34 PM) Robert Seidl: I think it’s possible that in the future Michael ends up being a good candidate for a certain story... The story goes like this...

Because of the founders delusional self confidence, the founder does get some investments from people he fools. He’ll be flying high on an infusion of capital into his baby, and waltzing around like a king.. until the investors start to realize a couple years later they’re not getting a return. The investors will start getting squeamish and concerned, and he will get defensive. How dare the investors not understand how he knows best to take care of his baby. Soon they’ll start fighting, and a trickle of more and more investors will demand their money back. They won’t get it back because he’ll already have spent it. They’ll sue. He’ll go bankrupt. Then he’ll come up with another idea, and move on to his next victims. 

The cycle repeats 😂

(12:47 AM) Robert Seidl: In the end (didn’t say ** the e** of the d*y 😝) hopefully it was a really good learning experience for most involved. Sometimes the things that go the least smooth / uncomfortable situations are actually the best learning experiences.
