(7:27 PM) Robert Seidl: It’s a blizzard right now, you’d love it 
(7:27 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼sophia and I are watching
(7:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼left my window open 
(8:08 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: finished.
(9:43 PM) Robert Seidl: Did you guys watch it all the way through with you?
(9:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes
(9:53 PM) Robert Seidl: Was it interesting?
(9:56 PM) Robert Seidl: Or just boring lol?
(9:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: there was lots of commentary 
(9:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but we got bored towards the last 5-10 min
(10:00 PM) Robert Seidl: Uh oh ya I figured if Sophia was watching it with you. 😬
(10:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and my roommate started chiming in 
(10:01 PM) Robert Seidl: 🤦‍♂️
(10:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: all extremely liberal polyscimajors 
(10:01 PM) Robert Seidl: 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
(10:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and her roommate walked in at one point 
(10:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: what 
(10:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: relax 
(10:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂
(10:03 PM) Robert Seidl: Hmmm.. maybe it’ll be even more interesting to hear your thoughts on the speech itself, and also on their commentary.
(10:05 PM) Robert Seidl: I wonder if their commentary (paralleled to the democratic Congress members reactions) juxtaposed against the speech was at all revealing.
(10:07 PM) Robert Seidl: I’ll bet that these couple of words were used a lot after trump would say something... “ya but....”
(10:10 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: sometimes it seemed like it did 
(10:10 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: other times the response was more of a “i’m not mad”
(10:10 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: no yeah but 
(10:10 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: more like “that’s a lie”
(10:11 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahahaha that was going to be the very next thing. 
(10:11 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: or “we have bigger problems, why is this being discussed here “
(10:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they were very angry the entire time 
(10:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I would low key slide in some things you told me and they would be like oh 
(10:14 PM) Robert Seidl: I could take every single thing they would “fact check” on fake news extensions like “Media Matters” and “Snopes” (all pushed by googles algorithm to the top of any news search) and enlighten them a bit and the error of their beliefs they’ve just been brain washed to believe by all of mainstream media.
(10:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol I wish you were here to just listen to the comments 
(10:15 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I debated recording some of the comments
(10:15 PM) Robert Seidl: There’d be a lotttttt of “oh’s” 😂😂😂😂
(10:15 PM) Robert Seidl: Then again I probably wouldn’t even try because they’d just start tuning out my logic pretty quickly. 
(10:15 PM) Robert Seidl: I wish you did.
(10:15 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: there would be a lot of arguing 
(10:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: these people are set in their ways
(10:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we were sitting tooooo close 
(10:16 PM) Robert Seidl: Exactly why I wouldn’t even bother 
(10:17 PM) Robert Seidl: They’re going to find a way to hate the orange nazi come hell or high water. After all, it’s a religion 😜
(10:17 PM) Robert Seidl: He could cure cancer and they’ll be like “he stole the cure from Russia!”
(10:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we were mainly making fun of the reactions 
(10:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: nancy gave 0 fucks
(10:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: cancer girl was bored asf
(10:18 PM) Robert Seidl: (I’m convinced she was desperate to hold her drool in)
(10:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: side note 
(10:19 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she still looked better then most of the people there
(10:20 PM) Robert Seidl: Was hilarious how she was forced to clap so much when every time she did you could tell she so desperately didn’t want to clap at all.
(10:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: do you know what bachata is 
(10:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she didn’t clap or stand up most of the time 
(10:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she just started reading and rolled her eyes at one point 
(10:21 PM) Robert Seidl: Is it a music?
(10:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: a dance style
