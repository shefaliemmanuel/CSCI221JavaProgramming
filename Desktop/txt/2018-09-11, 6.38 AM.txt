(6:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh wait read it wrong 
(6:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: my b cool yeah later 
(6:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Ha k
(6:42 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s pretty easy communicating with you through text than it is with most people so feel free to touch on anything now or just talk later about it 😉 
(6:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you just can’t not know can you 😏
(6:45 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha 
(6:45 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t curiousss but it’s no big deal 
(6:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: perfect no big deal 😉
(8:12 PM) Robert Seidl: Wow the hurricane is supposed to be really bad.. how hard do they think it’ll hit Charleston?
(8:20 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think it will just flood a bunch, but there are a couple tracking behind florence 
(8:20 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I have a lot of friends that are staying in charleston which is my main concern 
(8:21 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya that’s not worth it you never know how bad it’s going to be 
(8:22 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol you knowww I hear Chicago and St. Louis are supposed to be pretty safe from Florence... you know.. if you didn’t have anywhere else to go 😏
(8:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah i’m worried about them 😔
(8:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha kendall wanted me to fly back to kansas city with her, but my family is on this coast 
(8:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: thanks for the invite ☺️
(8:35 PM) Robert Seidl: You’re not still staying with family still on the coast are you?
(8:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m in charlotte 
(8:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but my parents are with their friends in SC 
(8:40 PM) Robert Seidl: Inland? 
(8:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes for both 
(8:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: like Clemson didn’t even cancel school
(8:43 PM) Robert Seidl: Clemson’s at the most inland tip so I guess that’s not too surprising, it’s much more elevated too.
(8:44 PM) Robert Seidl: But damn the whole coast from sc up could be hit really hard. Charlotte looks like it’s still going to get hit pretty hard.
(8:45 PM) Robert Seidl: But it’s so inland you’ll just get a lot of rain 
(8:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah one of my best friends is begging me to go visit her in Clemson this weekend so if charlotte gets bad enough my entire friend group is going to clemson 
(8:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: since most ppl live in charlotte 
(8:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we should have just gone to florida honestly 
(8:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we can deal with rain 
(8:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and just passing he time by going shopping so I can’t complain 😋
(1:33 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re positive you’re in a good spot?!! So you’re still in charlotte?
(2:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes i’m in charlotte- I won’t let Florence storm on my parade 😛
(5:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Soo cheesy... even for me.
(6:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I laughed out loud sooo
(7:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(11:26 AM) Robert Seidl: robert.seidl
(11:26 AM) Robert Seidl: @wustl.edu
(3:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: have fun staying awake in your classes!! 
(4:00 PM) Robert Seidl: ￼Ohh won’t be a problem. Just emptied out the rest of the matcha 🍵 bag 👍
(4:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t die 
(4:01 PM) Robert Seidl: #bigdick energy 
(4:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHAHA 
(4:09 PM) Robert Seidl: Hope you and all in your parade weather the storm safely! Maybe one solution to keeping it from storming too badly on your parade.. eat gelato in Florence. 
(4:15 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼with that thought Bentley and I are on the next plane to Italy
(5:13 AM) Robert Seidl: How’s the parade? Everyone still safe?
(5:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we spent the day doing homework + exploring new restaurants how were classes 
(5:20 AM) Robert Seidl: Good, I’ll sleep well tonight I believe 😉
(5:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol I snuck a nap in earlier 💤 
(5:21 AM) Robert Seidl: You better have with not having school and all! Otherwise you’d make me feel bad!
(5:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg no I’m so impressed that you stayed awake all day 
(5:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I might kinda feel really bad for putting you through all that 
(5:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Builds character
(5:25 AM) Robert Seidl: I didn’t want to drink caffeine after 7 so I won’t lie I was doing pushups during the bathroom break and using other various techniques to make it through the last one 😂
(5:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Normally I can handle a few hours of sleep every now and then but I had had about 4 hours for a few nights in a row so it had accumulated a good bit. 
(5:27 AM) Robert Seidl: The actual impressive thing is that I somehow was hardly tired at all while talking to you...
(5:27 AM) Robert Seidl: For 5 hours...
(5:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: please tell me someone walked into the bathroom when you were doing that
(5:27 AM) Robert Seidl: No haha 
(5:28 AM) Robert Seidl: But they have before lol 
(5:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Several times 
(5:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: one of my co workers used to do 100 push-ups every hour in the back of the apple store lol
(5:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHA
(5:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 4 hours a few nights in a row.... how are your eyes doing 😬
(5:30 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ll put it this way, I wouldn’t be keen on FaceTiming you right now lol
(5:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha 
(5:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but they prob hurt 
(5:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also 5 hours is that a new record 
(5:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Umm..
(5:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Holy shit it might be 
(5:33 AM) Robert Seidl: It’d be close but I honestly can’t remember another time talking to a girl where we talked thatttt long on the phone only. Maybe 3 hours with the extremely rare getting to 4. Skype yes though I think but not just talking on the phone. 
(5:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: impressive 
(5:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think the longest I’d spoken on the phone with someone was 4.5 
(5:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: face-timed for 8 hours 
(5:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol
(5:37 AM) Robert Seidl: The craziest part though.... it felt like nothing. Maybe a couple hours tops if that. 
(5:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: If you said it was an hour and a half I woulda believed you 
(5:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Probably could’ve talked longer if there were zero life obligations. Ya I guarantee we could have talked longer 😂
(5:40 AM) Robert Seidl: The absolute worst part though... 
(5:41 AM) Robert Seidl: Is that in the 3 hours tops I was asleep you were in a dream..
(5:42 AM) Robert Seidl: And I’ve hung out with you in person EIGHT days. That’s not good.
(5:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: WOW
(5:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: honestly whenever you were like I gotta go to bed in 3 min 
(5:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: when we would be in the middle of a conversation I might have remembered once or twice but selfishly didn’t interrupt you  
(5:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what happened in the dream??
(5:44 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha
(5:45 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya that’s confidential 
(5:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: are you sure 
(5:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😉😉😉
(5:51 AM) Robert Seidl: It was random AF and  didn’t make sense at all, we were in Chicago, and then one of my friends walked in and was asking us to hurry up so we could go somewhere (we weren’t “doing stuff” bahaha 😂 we were just chilling on the bed and your head was resting on my chest). And somehow you knew my random ass friend it seemed for a long time. And next thing we were at the bean riding those scooters 😂😂😂, and all of a sudden an ex gf showed up and we were trying to ride away from her 😂😂😂😂. That was it. 
(6:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHHA i’ve been waiting for those like scooters to come to CHS
(6:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: jealous I rarely dream 
(6:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Hmm I don’t know if you should be riding them there without me watching your behind 🤔
(6:04 AM) Robert Seidl: ^i meant this literally 
(6:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sounds like you’re going to have to come down then 
(6:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: quite literally 
(6:06 AM) Robert Seidl: The only downside to the scooters was that you didn’t have to lean / bend over at all and could stand straight up. You should have to ride one specially made with the handles extra far forward in front. 
(6:06 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂
(6:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god
(6:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHA
(6:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you should make them 
(6:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Thing is... given the resources, I actually would
(6:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it wouldn’t be hard 
(6:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: even just from reassembling a lime
(6:10 AM) Robert Seidl: If done by my hands, it would take quite some time lol
(6:12 AM) Robert Seidl: I was imagining more a scenario where I just ordered one and it showed up purely as a joke. (Hypothetically speaking of course) it’d be the kind of joke I’d surprise you with a long time from now when you’d almost completely  forgotten about it.
(6:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I’d want to see how you explained making this to someone 
(6:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that would prob be the best part 
(6:14 AM) Robert Seidl: I would record it then or keep the transcript 
(6:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHA thank you
(6:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Which would then only encourage me to be further obnoxious with my description.
(6:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol I can only imagine 
(6:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I bet the other person would cringe 
(6:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: or slowly realize
