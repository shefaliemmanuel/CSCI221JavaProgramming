(12:17 AM) Robert Seidl: The general concept of ownership of property isn’t nearly as strong in many other countries as it is in the US. The psychology that you’re  almost always a renter or a tenant in many other European countries has its roots in medieval feudalism and fiefdom where you never owned your own property and you were used to your role in that system as a servant to the powers that be as opposed to a free individual with inalienable rights which also extend to your property. 
(12:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ve been invited to be friends with the spain kids but my friends haven’t????

(2:47 PM) Robert Seidl: That is strange 
(3:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: maybe they are trying to kidnap me idk 
(3:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Wait what..
(3:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Are you getting even the tiniest bit of that vibe???
(3:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: have you read intermediated microeconomics 
(3:32 PM) Robert Seidl: No not if that’s the book name 
(3:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s apparently one of the most famous econ books read all over the world 
(3:33 PM) Robert Seidl: We obviously went over various micro and macro economic concepts in managerial economics 
(3:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: written by the chief economist of google I believe 
(3:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: well yeah but that specific books
(3:34 PM) Robert Seidl: There’s probably dozens of books with intermediate economics in the title..

(3:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but no I didn’t get that vibe I think they just like to party 
(3:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I shouldn’t make jokes like that
(3:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol.. I said no
(3:38 PM) Robert Seidl: No you shouldn’t, you make me feel really helpless all the way over here 😂

(8:20 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: soooooo I randomly was in a debate for like 1 ½ hours today

(8:21 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol he’s solid on  sweeping generalizations
(8:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he teaches econ students around the world.... 😂😂😂
(8:22 PM) Robert Seidl: Of course you did.. when reason combined with humility is on your side you always win... because you better reach truth.
(8:23 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha I’ll bet 95% of the people assigned to read the book, maybe cracked a page.. or two.
(8:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he’s also made this statement today that was asking if we had ever seen a politician and an economist be besties in a professional setting and was like high chances you won’t
(8:24 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it made me crack up 
(8:24 PM) Robert Seidl: In other words when you have reason combined with humility the other person is more willing to concede and adjust since they know you were willing to concede whenever you might be wrong. 
(8:25 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: dude everyone was getting so heated because there was one phd student in the class and he got on the other team and he was just so cocky and annoying he like automatically started running their team  
(8:25 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya... well I’d like to meet an economist that had two hands...
(8:25 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and I deflected everything he said in a kind manner and some of my friends on the team were getting vicious 
(8:26 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was HILARIOUS 
(8:26 PM) Robert Seidl: Because every damn economist I talk to is always saying “on the one hand” or “on the other hand”
(8:26 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: fuck off hahahhaha
(8:26 PM) Robert Seidl: (Truth is thats lawyers too)
(8:27 PM) Robert Seidl: (Their version is “it depends”)
(8:27 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i wish you could have seen it 
(8:27 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: prof Ricardo was def on my side 
(8:28 PM) Robert Seidl: Always stay strong if you still have strong convictions... all the while simultaneously challenging your own convictions from others ideas to make sure you should still strongly hold them 😉
(8:28 PM) Robert Seidl: I CAN see it
(8:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: one of my friends on the other team was like you keep putting all these clauses in your statements to protect your team mates 
(8:29 PM) Robert Seidl: I can definitely picture it 😜

(8:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: NOOOOO
(8:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Still applies though if he meant it to you or your leader.
(8:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: no one said it to me
(8:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: one sec
(8:32 PM) Robert Seidl: Because the PhD has a PhD next to a name but is insecure because deep down he still knows he’s ever the moron 
(8:33 PM) Robert Seidl: If no one hates you, no one can love you.
(8:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Stass (friend on Opposing Team): Shefali stop putting these clauses in  your statements to protect your team 

Julia (fiery teammate from Russia): calls Stass a dumb fuck 
(8:33 PM) Robert Seidl: Which reminds me...
