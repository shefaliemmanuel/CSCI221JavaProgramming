(1:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sooo air came home to Evan in my room and Karissa straight up spoke to me 
(1:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and they both looked me dead in the eye??
(2:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think sophia resents me 
(2:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we ended up having a group of guys follow us (Sophia, Chubby, and I) around tonight and she made a comment that was like “of course this is happening it always does everywhere we go...”
(2:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think this is why she likes hanging out with georgia and nineke because this never happens when she’s with them 
(2:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ya know
(2:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Awe you think Sophia might resent you?
(2:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Also that is a strange looking water park and I have no idea what you guys are doing with your hands hahaha
(2:31 AM) Robert Seidl: You look cute though 
(9:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(9:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: all the water parks in estonia are also saunas, steam rooms, and 
(9:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hot tubs   
(9:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeahhhhh
(9:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: idk what to do about it
(9:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she was getting pissed about it
(10:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: our hands is like a compilation of jokes
(10:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we are strange
(11:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: do you really think just cutting offff comments completely is going to solve the problem or even tame it 
(11:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: how is someone supposed to transition from having no comments to all of a sudden getting comments one year
(11:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the style and type of comments doesn’t changed based on the producers age 
(11:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I 1000% think this should be a parents choice VS random youtube management choice 
(11:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so i’m glad they have that feature 
(11:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: why is the default mode set to no comments 
(11:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t think the default option bias will will win in this case
(11:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: think about why people even put content on the internet 
(11:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: almost every reason I can think of stems from feedback 
(11:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I get that they are trying to reduce content 
(11:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: as she said they remove x # of video yearly 
(11:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: *which she highlighted some don’t even have a view or more* 
(11:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but simply because a video doesn’t “have a view” doesn’t mean it’s poor in nature 
(11:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: or needs to be disposed of 
(11:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: could it possibly be that the algorithms that display these videos are not tailored to all types of videos???!
(11:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: simply focus on what youtube wants its viewers to focus on???
(11:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no no corporate america would NEVER do such a thing
(11:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I wanna throw up at her diversity spiel 
(11:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: “let’s go to colleges we don’t normally go to and show google what a diverse tech company does”
(11:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Yikes she just kept repeating the same couple of bullet points for the first 20 min
(11:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: would you be open to put an employee on a board for a company? 
(11:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also sounds like a hype conference to go to 
(11:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ooooffffff I can’t imagine her interview with Mark
