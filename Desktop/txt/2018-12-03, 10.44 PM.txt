(10:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼got the prettiest bowl today
(10:51 PM) Robert Seidl: That does look darn good. Get that brain food 
(11:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: terrabase is presenting at 5:30! will keep you posted- seems like they have forgotten 90% of the public speaking skills they gained
(2:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yikes the result was no bueno, but i don’t think that’s a surprise 
(2:22 AM) Robert Seidl: 🙁 Feel bad for those girls 
(2:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he’s cutting them out tonight
(2:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol I swear this kid thinks he’s Steve Jobbs / JD Rockeffeler / and JP Morgan all rolled into one and reincarnate 😂
(2:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they didn’t even place in the top 4/6  according to the judges 
(2:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(2:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this was all based on audience
(2:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Doesn’t it show they got second in the pic?
(2:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah but this was just the audience voting on who they think did the best
(2:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the judges liked village TRTULE and Dominate 
(2:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: TRTLE
(2:31 AM) Robert Seidl: I had a feeling any experienced judge or industry professional would see right through Michael and actually not like him investment wise even if he would be a good presenter by his peers standards.
(2:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Is that him in the bottom right of the picture?
(2:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHA no that’s my old mentor from Boeing 
(2:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah and see right through the girls purely memorizing lines and not understanding the concept 
(2:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but at least they presented well!!! 
(2:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: some teams really fucked up in their questions like Starr’s face was WTF half the time 
(2:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol and who the hells fault is it that they didn’t understand the concept. The best concepts are usually able to be boiled down into a simple and succinctly articulated value propositions... otherwise seemingly overcomplexity actually means there isn’t that good of a value prop at all 
(2:36 AM) Robert Seidl: States attorney (in Illinois) just asked me to help them on a case for a triple homicide but I don’t think there’s any way I can with finals. If it was here in STL I’d do it of course. 
(2:37 AM) Robert Seidl: If I wasn’t doing an MBA I’d be able to. 
(2:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i didn’t get the concept fully until the 4/5 time i met with them 
(2:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: OMG WAIT THATS SO EXCITING 
(2:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: congrats 
(2:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: might be able to swing it or absolutely not??
(2:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol ya it’s good he thought of me. 
(2:41 AM) Robert Seidl: They want someone working on site 24/7 starting tomorrow... I offered Mr. Knapp to do anything they might need remotely but I think they need someone on site to look at hours of tape and conduct the discovery process for the prosecutor.
(2:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: could you join them after finals???
(2:43 AM) Robert Seidl: The trial has been sped up so the bulk of the work would be done by then. Told him I’d be happy to help during Christmas and after but by then it might not be necessary. 
(2:44 AM) Robert Seidl: Hopefully they’ll have something during the spring for a few weeks because I’d just work remotely on classes for a bit and get externship permission.
(2:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m sure they would totally have something for you in the Spring 
(2:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: or find something for you to do if they didn’t 😉
(2:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Good contact to have for sure 
(2:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not even out of law school yet and getting recruited 
(2:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so impressive
