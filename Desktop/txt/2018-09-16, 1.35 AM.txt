(1:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya um.. now my mind is going to be anything but focused during this meeting..
(1:56 AM) Robert Seidl: I fucking love your body 
(1:56 AM) Robert Seidl: But not* focused
(1:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol one of my friends is trying to become a photographer and she’s been wanting to try random shoots so we did one
(1:58 AM) Robert Seidl: Omg feel free to have her do a thousand more 😂😂😂 from all kinds of angles
(1:59 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s what you should do as a good friend... give her a ton of practice and be as clothing light as you want 😂

(2:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you will rarely receive a selfie from me 
(2:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like extremely rare 
(2:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Definitelyyyy do. I stronglyyy support it 😂. And I don’t think there’d be an outfit I wouldn’t want to see on you (including the type of outfit where there’s nothing OBVI lol). 

Walking into the meeting. I am so glad that wasn’t what I thought it was going to be! I’m literally only going to be thinking about what I would do to you now... why do visuals of you have to have such a strong effect on me?!!! 
(2:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god “OBVI” hahahha 
(2:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I hope I don’t always send you work!! 
(2:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: def wanna heat about what you’re thinking about later 
(2:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: because men are visually stimulated?? lol
(2:11 AM) Robert Seidl: Also for the record... I also don’t know if I’ve ever liked receiving a pic so much for whatever reason. 
(2:12 AM) Robert Seidl: You’ll want to be alone when you do 😜
(2:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: haha I have a couple more 
(2:13 AM) Robert Seidl: Great now if my phone is vibrating during the meeting I won’t be able to look due to possible contents, and I’ll just be wondering
(2:14 AM) Robert Seidl: I hate you 
(2:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Bye
(2:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Love you too hahaha
byeeeeee
(4:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Yaa soo at one point when someone was rambling I began thinking of you, and I had a full erection trying to bust through my suit pants... not cool. Actually kind painful. Had to wait until it was a “halfy” before I stood to keep it from being completely obvious.
(4:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Kinda*
(4:04 AM) Robert Seidl: Headed to the gym now, so it better not be present by the time I’m doing deadlifts 😂
(4:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the things I would do to be in that meeting with you 😂😂😂
