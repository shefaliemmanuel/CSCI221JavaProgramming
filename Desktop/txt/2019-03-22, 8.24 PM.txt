(1:27 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼￼
(4:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(8:03 PM) Robert Seidl: ￼
My dad sent me this text a little bit ago... so I immediately worriedly call him... and he reveals to me it was a joke.....

(8:04 PM) Robert Seidl: What.. the fuck....
(8:04 PM) Robert Seidl: Who jokes about that?!
(8:05 PM) Robert Seidl: I was so mad I thought Reece was in jail 😂😂😂😂😂
(8:07 PM) Robert Seidl: (Love the doggy) (and ya? Haha tell me about the dream!)
(8:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god 💀💀💀
(8:15 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha he answers and he’s like, “oh... no that was just a joke, but I do need legal advice on the condo.”
(8:15 PM) Robert Seidl: 🤦‍♂️
(8:17 PM) Robert Seidl: I can see the headline now... “son dies from  heart attack due to dad’s prank” 
(8:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha dad jokes 
(8:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it is kinda funny 
(8:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: not gonna lie
(8:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂
(8:17 PM) Robert Seidl: 😡 😡 😡😡😡😡😡
(8:18 PM) Robert Seidl: He thought it was hilarious....
(8:18 PM) Robert Seidl: Because of how upset I was after I realized it was a “joke”
(8:20 PM) Robert Seidl: For him the funniest part is always peoples reactions to his ridiculous jokes. (I knoww I knowww this might sound a bit familiar 🤦‍♂️)
(8:20 PM) Robert Seidl: I don’t like it when it’s done to me 
(8:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: makes it 1929302x better
(8:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lilllllll bit familiar 
(8:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: wonder where you got it from 😛
(8:24 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: what has happened to my youtube notifications ?????￼
(8:29 PM) Robert Seidl: ￼Oh ya btw the mueller report came out today... the reports are that there are no indictments in trump Russia collusion at all. [And to add some context it’s simply a prosecutor’s brief meaning it’s even SUPPOSED to be biased against trump -> that’s one of the aspects of an adversarial court system... so that’s the equivalent of the prosecutor saying “well I can’t even prosecute him because there’s ZERO legal EVIDENCE]
(8:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
(8:33 PM) Robert Seidl: Mueller / Fyre memes are taking over... 

Rachael Maddow was almost in tears, Chris Hayes glasses were fogging up, Bill Maher refuses to accepts the findings even though he told everyone for two years how they had to accept the findings of mueller (even though that’s dumb AF since it would simply be the prosecutors allegations... due process... helloooo 😂😂😂)
(8:33 PM) Robert Seidl: !!!!! On the YouTube!
(8:35 PM) Robert Seidl: I know exactly! They are blatantly boosting mainstream news when almost NO-ONE goes to YouTube for mainstream news. It’s gotten terrible over the past two years. It’s only ever mainstream junk in the recommended and trending when you search for any news issue!!
(8:35 PM) Robert Seidl: Sounds like... COLLUSION!!!!!
(8:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh boy
(8:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s a lot 
(8:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m here for the memes

(9:26 PM) Robert Seidl: I couldn’t find the clip on YouTube anymore (censored naturally), but listen to minute 14-18 approximately, as this crazy progressive interviewer actually tries to push on the YouTube exec for the further banning of mainstream conservatives.
(9:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(9:40 PM) Robert Seidl: Such a great butt!!! Soo cute 😊!!
(9:43 PM) Robert Seidl: I just want to grab your hips and peel those panties off terribly !!

(9:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: will watch the video when I get back!!
