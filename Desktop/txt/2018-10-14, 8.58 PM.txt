(1:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Great comment from the video: ‚ÄúThere I was, just foraging for food, when suddenly I went blind for no reason at all!  Couldn't see a thing!  As I was trying to figure out what was going on, I got attacked by some primate who kept trying to yank my head off!  Luckily I got away, but later I was attacked by a whole pack of primates, grabbing me and holding me down and chewing on my neck!  Just then the blindness went away and I was able to fight them all off.  Primates are terrible.Ôªø‚Äù
