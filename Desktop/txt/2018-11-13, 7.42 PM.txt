(7:42 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol just found out my family will be in Charleston the 2nd weekend after thanksgiving (28th through the first of December). Reece is doing his “pre-knob” visit to the citadel during that hahaha. I wouldn’t want to impose if you’d be too busy (and no rush if you’re unsure still what your schedule is going to be during that time), but if you think you’d be free, then I could maybe join them in Charleston for a couple days that weekend. 
(7:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ll just be studying for finals please feel free to come!!!!!
(7:54 PM) Robert Seidl: Hmmm 
(7:55 PM) Robert Seidl: Last thing I’d want to do is impede on your studying for finals..
(7:58 PM) Robert Seidl: I’d likely only be able to get in Friday and fly out Sunday, but would also be able to study with you a little / just chill with my fam while you could get some study time.
(9:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Honestly I’m planning on studying over all thanksgiving break sooo that would be perfect
(9:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you would not be impeding at allllll
(9:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also feel free to come in Thursday night again or anytime friday which ever one works better!!
