(4:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(1:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(1:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(1:09 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(6:41 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol those are cool chairs 
(7:03 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol to the top picture.... the world is not ending, there’s simply protective barriers being built (which have been built in multiple areas for decades) on the border. 

She also might be upset about even MSNBC and some other liberal news sources beginning the slow trickle of quietly admitting that after 2 years of the left brainwashing their base to believe trump colluded with Putin, that there is ZERO evidence (isn’t even any “circumstantial” evidence) that trump ever colluded with Russia. In fact, just as I’ve said all along... all of the evidence of Russian collusion is with Hillary Clinton. A lot of never trumpers are very upset about that. 

Simultaneously, trumps opponents had a very bad couple of weeks politically (the abortion stuff blew up in their face, Ocasio Cortez’s green new deal was such a disaster that she took it off of her website after it was up for two days, and that same democrat governor who was on tape saying infanticide was ok was caught wearing blackface in pictures with someone in a KKK outfit -> remember what I said about Democrats being the real racists)...... Soo ya.... not a good couple of news weeks for lefty college students 😂😂😂
(8:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the ugliest decor I have ever seen in a club
(8:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and they had bacardi pillows all over
(8:03 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the top picture as chubby and I or my poly sci friend (don’t know because you went straight into “she also”)
(8:04 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah she is the most liberal person I have ever met in my life
(8:04 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and she has been this way since like middle school
(8:04 PM) Robert Seidl: The last text was for your poli-sci friend  
(8:04 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she goes to George Washington University
(8:05 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha triggered lefty  snowflakes bring me joy 😂😂😂
(8:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: well then you should just look at 90% of my social media feeds
(8:06 PM) Robert Seidl: They don’t bring me thattt much joy 
(8:07 PM) Robert Seidl: They all just parrot cnn talking points anyways 
(8:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahhaha
(8:09 PM) Robert Seidl: The level of ignorance it takes to still be a lefty that really believes trump is in cahutes with the Kremlin is simply astounding  
(8:09 PM) Robert Seidl: You have to just literally avoid looking into any facts 
(8:15 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol very European club decor... randomness. 
(8:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah shooters is my home
(8:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: its modern and everything is glass
(8:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and they have better lights
(8:34 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I’m writing this paper on the decision making process and ethical behavior principles
(8:34 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: of doctors with billionaire patients
(8:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and it seems like econ is the common denominator amongst all my class
(8:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: even some of the computer science ones
(8:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: which is not exactly what I expected
(8:38 PM) Robert Seidl: That’s a good thing right!
(8:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes but I didn’t see it coming 
(8:39 PM) Robert Seidl: I mean a billionaire is going to be able to find plenty of doctors that will prescribe any drug / treatment and do anything they want
(8:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: many doctors are not ethical 
(8:40 PM) Robert Seidl: Very true
(8:41 PM) Robert Seidl: Last I checked doctors still have to be made up out of humans 
(8:41 PM) Robert Seidl: We’ve had trouble finding enough angels to put there 😜
(8:42 PM) Robert Seidl: Just like anything run by humans... there will be corruption and fraudulent behavior 
(8:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also this professor is so dumb she converted an american show into estonian and then made russian subtitles for a CLASS IN ENGLISH
(8:42 PM) Robert Seidl: No imagine if all medicine was controlled by the government!!!!!
(8:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahahaha I don’t want to 
(8:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it is in Estonia 
(8:43 PM) Robert Seidl: Even more Corrupt and inefficient then 
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Everyone saw one of my Ibuprofen bottles and they were like oh my god so many colorful pills 
(8:43 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha imagine if you had to get Estonian healthcare your whole life 😂
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they were like will this last you a couple of years 
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the healthcare here is very good 
(8:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: part of the reason tatsiana won’t move to america until her daughter is older 
(8:44 PM) Robert Seidl: Isn’t tatsiana connected in Estonia though?
(8:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she’s from belarus 
(8:45 PM) Robert Seidl: Husband?
(8:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she is a permanent estonian resident but she’s not an estonian 
(8:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: her husband is finish 
(8:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they are looked as outsiders to the government 
(8:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they can’t get credit cards or loans 
(8:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they have to pay everything in cash 
(8:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: like she’s building a house in Tallinn and they have to pay everyone by cash 
(8:46 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol idk I’d bet if someone ever had a serious medical issue they’d rather be at the Mayo Clinic than anywhere in Estonia....
(8:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: everything is included here
(8:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: like if anything happened to me as an international student I wouldn’t be changed any medical bills 
(8:47 PM) Robert Seidl: Right, so if you don’t have a serious medical issue.. you’re fine 
(8:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: since I am technically a citizen of estonia and I have international health care 
(8:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: even serious ones are okay here i’ve heard 
(8:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but i’m not positive 
(8:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and if there is a cost for those serious ones it’s quite low
(8:49 PM) Robert Seidl: ^ I’m no expert on Estonian healthcare, but I’d be very curious to do looking into the comparisons of quality across various medical fields 
(8:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah that was my first thought as well
(8:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: how is it fiscally possibly 
(8:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: with high quality 
(8:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Many Europeans no absolutely nothing about American healthcare and are just told by their governments and given the impression that American healthcare is too expensive and not as good 
(8:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼￼￼
