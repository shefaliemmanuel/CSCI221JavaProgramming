(3:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Seen “Knock Down The House” on Netflix yet?
(3:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: https://www.netflix.com/title/81080637?s=i&trkid=13747225&t=amsg
(11:19 PM) Robert Seidl: How’d it go?!
(11:19 PM) Robert Seidl: I haven’t seen anything on Netflix for months aside from that one documentary 
(11:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was strange 
(11:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ve never written a feelings based final exam 
(11:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ⅓ was based on facts so I know I got that 
(11:41 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha
(11:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I legit thought of every argument I could make 
(11:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was like 8 
(11:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I wrote straight for all 3 hours 
(11:42 PM) Robert Seidl: That’s the only way most college students write any of their exams not as directly related to mathematics 😂
(11:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lmao yeah sophia told me 
(11:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she was like this is most poly sci and business exams 
(11:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m not a fan 
(11:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: her grading basically depends on her mood
(11:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: idk I don’t really care of these opinion based subjects 
(11:43 PM) Robert Seidl: They spend all of undergrad talking about their feelings until they get into the real world and realize it doesn’t give a fuck about their feelings (nor should it)
(11:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was a waste of time personally 
(11:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t get me wrong I enjoyed the class 
(11:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I ended up watching the documentary the case study was derived from andy prof and I geeked out about it when I turned it in
(11:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so I hope i’m okay 
(11:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we all need a 50 on the final to pass the course 
(11:47 PM) Robert Seidl: I agree with you. Real poli sci shouldn’t even be graded like that though it should be graded not on the opinions advanced but on the logical strength of arguments (but of course liberal teachers just want to see their opinions parroted back to them) 
(11:47 PM) Robert Seidl: You got an A+ 
(11:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: these classes give me the same feeling as a kid doing something horrible and the parent being like “you’re perfect honey” 
(11:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we’ll see 
(11:48 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol yup.
(11:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Honestly I would’ve gone mad going to another college other than the citadel because so many of the professors are so lefty in areas like poli sci that their open discriminators against anyone remotely conservative, white, or male. 
(11:51 PM) Robert Seidl: Citadels professors were still hardcore liberal but at least there were 1 or 2 ex military professors that always balanced out the lefty nonsense 
(11:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: professors here are CRAZY open minded 
(11:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: surprisingly 
(11:51 PM) Robert Seidl: Nice 
(11:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but I’ve heard the poly sci ones are crazy 
(11:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: like talk about random stuff 
(11:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: today I sat in on one of sophia’s classes where they talked about Poland stance on the word gender
(11:53 PM) Robert Seidl: 🤦‍♂️
(11:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: W
(11:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I
(11:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: L
(11:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: D
(11:53 PM) Robert Seidl: That’s what I’m saying.... perfect example of complete and utter lefty nonsense and indoctrination 
(11:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh and I started the creative brain
(11:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: what do you mean it’s what their politicians are saying 
(11:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it not framing it seems to be factual 
(11:55 PM) Robert Seidl: How about.... you’re biologically just a male or a female?!!!! —— “Gasp.. BLASPHEMY!”
(11:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhhh 
(11:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah but you can have the word gender 
(11:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: gender it’s self is not the problem
(11:59 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes it is a problem in the way they’re using it’s. Gender always used to be the same as saying male or female in dictionaries. Feminists decided they were going to bend its definition. It’s used as a post modern feminist vehicle of obfuscation of male or female, and the non-scientific narrative that your gender can be anywhere on a vast spectrum based on the individual’s... wait for it... “FEELINGS”!!!!!!
(11:59 PM) Robert Seidl: It* not “it’s” at the beginning 
(12:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Now it makes even more sense why Sophia admits every one of her CofC political science exams is based on feelings.. doesn’t it.. 😂😂😂😂😂
(12:02 AM) Robert Seidl: The whole narrative comes down to victim classes and their personal “feelings” of victimization at the expense of others privileges over them..... traditional facts, science, and logic be damned. 
(12:04 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya and they just simply say that any facts, science, or logic that runs counter to the narrative that they “felt” like advancing... is simply fruit of the white colonial patriarchal tree and therefore entirely invalid. 
(12:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i fucking hate that so much
(12:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: PEOPLE ARE NEVER PERFECTLY RIGHT 
(12:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: stop treating them like they are 
(12:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Remember on of the core Marxist means of achieving the communist end: destroy, obfuscate, and confuse all intellectual boundaries of language, science, and reasoning. Make up down and down up. Make a girl a boy and a boy a girl. Make someone based on nothing more than their skin color an oppressor and call them a racist for their inherent born into oppression. 
(12:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no wonder school is easy 
(12:08 AM) Robert Seidl: One* not “on” at the beginning 
(12:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah no shit if you just write about how you feel about something regardless of the reality of the situation 
(12:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Always project onto others what you yourself are guilty of doing. 
(12:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: AHHAHAA the best part at the end was that she was like “wow poland is too conservative for me” “id still go visit” 
(12:10 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
(12:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: tooooooo*
(12:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i was like okay legit fuck off right now 
(12:10 AM) Robert Seidl: She’s garbage 
(12:10 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m sorry 
(12:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hey i know 
(12:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she came crawling back when she realized no one cares about her
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼what I opened my phone to post exam 

(12:11 AM) Robert Seidl: Notice what those guys tricking psychology academics did when publishing those hilarious papers.... it was always brought back towards feelings and they never needed any evidence 
(12:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Right, you called her bluff (which was just an attempt at manipulation) and she took notice 
(12:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah honestly 
(12:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Notice: what she did with you personally is the same thing these college students are being trained to do everywhere......

Make wildly dramatic gestures based on their feelings as attempts to manipulate others into submitting to their new rules, definitions, and boundaries.

ALSO NOTICE: in the these same attempts at manipulation you always have the same goal; POWER and CONTROL. This is why I keep telling you Shefali they are AUTHORITARIANS. 
(12:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Ninenke called it
(12:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhhh joe wants to get lunch when you’re in town
(12:17 AM) Robert Seidl: They’re the kid on the playground who runs to their mommy and the teacher to ban the kid from the sandbox who stood up to them when they tried to steal his toy. 
(12:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i was dramatic af and threw her bracelet in the trash this morning
(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I believe it 
(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I never was friends with those kids 
(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but they seem to be everywhere now
(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(12:19 AM) Robert Seidl: At the age of 5, you were already more mature than 95% of current leftist college indoctrinated students. 
(12:19 AM) Robert Seidl: YES!!!
(12:19 AM) Robert Seidl: They ARE everywhere now!
(12:20 AM) Robert Seidl: Because they leftists completely took control of universities everywhere and have been pumping these toddlers out into the real world like a well oiled machine for decades!!!
(12:20 AM) Robert Seidl: The* not “they”
(12:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol 
(12:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what a mess
(12:22 AM) Robert Seidl: Again Notice: the Marxist agenda repeatedly alludes to the fact that it WANTS a MESS
(12:22 AM) Robert Seidl: It is literally all right there for anybody with an ounce of curiosity to read. 
(12:23 AM) Robert Seidl: The goal is not bettering society (or the playground / sandbox)... 

The goal is CONTROL.
(12:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: awh man 
(12:26 AM) Robert Seidl: So what do you think shefali? Do you think it’s a good idea for us to let these toddlers control the rules and boundaries of our society?
(12:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes of course 
(12:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: best idea ever
(12:27 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂
(12:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: why didn’t i think of that
(12:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh yeah because IM NOT A COMPLETE IDIOT 
(12:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just a lil bit 
(12:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Btw this is why there’s nothing these people hate more than people like me who believe in the critical importance of the freedom of the individual.
(12:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i get it 
(12:30 AM) Robert Seidl: A potential reinvigoration of public support for individual freedom is the thing that stands most strongly in any authoritarian’s way...
(12:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’re messing up the flow
(12:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: (thank God)
(12:31 AM) Robert Seidl: I think you’re beginning to see why I believe this is so important. No big deal, it’s only the survival of any freedom that’s at stake 😂😂😂
(12:33 AM) Robert Seidl: I do not want these megalomaniacs in control of telling my kids and grandkids how they have to live their lives. 
(12:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha 
(12:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah 
(12:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just brainwash then yourself 
(12:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it will be fine 
(12:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂
(12:40 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s the thing though... they won’t be ALLOWED to be divergent from the hive. 

I’m really not trying to sound hyperbolic here... but hundreds of millions of people have died as a result of Marxist’s taking over all over the world in the past hundred years alone. Divergents are first stripped of individual rights, then put into prison camps, and then into mass graves. Just read a history book, there’s not one time that Marxism taking control doesn’t turn out like a real live version of the hunger games. 

Shit, just look at Venezuela right now!! I was warning you that Venezuela was a collapsed Marxist ticking time bomb when we started hanging out... and now it’s happening. 

Lol ok I’m done 😂
(12:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol if you’re not my roommate just left 
(12:42 AM) Robert Seidl: I don’t always end up predicting these things because I’m some kind of genius...  
(12:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha
(12:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Listening to an audio lecture for a class I might take 
(12:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhhhhh
(12:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what’s it about
(1:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Marketing 
(1:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Specifically price analysis 
(1:28 AM) Robert Seidl: You still up?
(7:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i am now
(4:52 PM) Robert Seidl: You up now lol?
(4:52 PM) Robert Seidl: Hope you’re having a great day 😉
(5:03 PM) Robert Seidl: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l7op92W7voE
(5:25 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼idk if you can tell from g eyes but we’re about to nap
