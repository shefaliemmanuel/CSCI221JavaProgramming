(10:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she also asked N and I to meet with her separately last night 
(10:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but she sent us the text individually when we were sitting right next to each other 😂
(10:33 PM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂
(10:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and then we were in the kitchen and she came out and we were like what did you want to talk to us about
(10:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and she was like oh i just wanted to make sure we were okay 
(10:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and her and georgia have been weird and extra fake

(10:36 PM) Robert Seidl: Awe
(10:36 PM) Robert Seidl: Is something going on in Georgia’s life or something?
(10:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: no nothing 
(10:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she’s just bored 
(10:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and she’s going against everything she told us
(10:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: about her standards 
(10:40 PM) Robert Seidl: What do you mean? 
(10:41 PM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(10:43 PM) Robert Seidl: Btw China is one of those countries... it has zero tolerance for homosexuality 
(10:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she was like i would never speak to those people they are horrible 
(10:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: like poor quality
(10:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and now because sophia is hanging out with them and we are studying all the time
(10:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she goes with them 
(10:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and before she would just be like “I won’t go if I don’t like the people”
(10:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahah i’m aware about china 
(10:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I only saw straight people there
(10:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and have heard lots about it from joe 
(10:47 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya... the openly gay people are dead or in prison...
(10:47 PM) Robert Seidl: ...or “disappeared”
(10:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is only a part of the deal with georgia 
(10:47 PM) Robert Seidl: Gotcha 
(10:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we have just been getting weird vibes for a few weeks now
(10:48 PM) Robert Seidl: It infuriates me how no one talks about the communist Chinese government killing over 20 million people in the last few decades 
(10:48 PM) Robert Seidl: Several times MORE than the holocaust 
(10:49 PM) Robert Seidl: Gotcha (on Georgia) 
(10:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Idk, can always extend an olive branch though you never know she could just be dealing with some stuff 
(10:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she was fine last night 
(10:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: there’s nothing up with her that we can tell
(10:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she’s just in her head more 
(10:51 PM) Robert Seidl: Or maybe it had something to do with the one thing where she told you about that guy 
(10:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she has been done with class. since last week 
(10:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and all of us have been studying 24/7
(10:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so maybe 
(10:52 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya maybe she’s even sad that you’re not able to hang with her due to having to study 
(10:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: “that’s fucking stupid”- N and Shef
(10:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she’s also following sophia around and she never would before 
(10:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and sophia is following poor quality people 
(10:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: shit went down today in the library between us and them

(10:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: “it was some next level shit”- N
(10:54 PM) Robert Seidl: Meanwhile Apple is threatening to boycott Georgia (the state) because of their pro-life laws..... yet they have no problem with paying 1 dollar an hour to thousands of Chinese working in slave labor conditions and handing over the code to their company to that same Chinese government who commits all of those human rights violations.
(10:56 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha drama huh?
(10:57 PM) Robert Seidl: And sorry for bringing Apple into that as I know you loved working there lol 
(10:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: “he knows you’re triggered”- N
(10:59 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya btw here’s some more irony for ya... Tim Cook is gay, yet more and more partnering with the authoritarian communist regime that executes gays....... 

Talk about principles. 

But hey, let’s ban Georgia!! (The state) 
(11:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: no one likes Tim
(11:00 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya I never have 
(11:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah same 
(11:02 PM) Robert Seidl: But how 🤥 is he.... oh ya Tim your sooo woke... keep supporting the regime committing the most human rights violations in the last century. 
(11:05 PM) Robert Seidl: I’ll let you get back to your studying! Feel free to call after! (that might be easier to explain to me the Georgia situation)

(10:16 PM) Robert Seidl: Orange man bad orange man bad orange man bad 
(10:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: BIG YIKes
(10:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(10:17 PM) Robert Seidl: Is that your response to Maria lol?
(10:20 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s my respond to “orange man bad”
(10:21 PM) Robert Seidl: It’s just like when trump was the first president in history to implement criminal justice reform shortening jail sentences for minorities in jail for non-violent crimes..... and NONE of the mainstream media covered it, and that very week it happened every trump hater (without a rational explanation) just kept saying “he’s a racist, he’s a racist, he’s a racist!”
(10:23 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha that’s my imitation of trump derangement syndrome at work.... “these facts are.. too.. much... for my brain... orange man bad, orange man bad”
(10:23 PM) Robert Seidl: (And it’s funny because he is orange 😂)
(10:28 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god ahahahaha
(10:28 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah mia is not open to anything positive about him
(10:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: like what so ever 
(10:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I always listen to what trump supporters say 
(10:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: there is no in between
(10:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Shefali, “hey Maria, did you hear? Trump cured cancer!” 

Maria, “hahaha it’s BS though” 

Shefali, “no I’m serious like my dad’s a Dr. and he confirmed it. And every medical professional agrees. Why is it BS?”

Maria, “orange man bad”

Shefali, “okayy, um, I’ll give you that he is orange.. but why is it BS specifically?” 

Maria, “he’s a racist”

Shefali, “ok but what about curing cancer?” 

Maria, “he just wants to take attention away from aids research, because he’s a homophobe” 

Shefali, “remember that tweet I sent you about trump advocating support for gay rights around the world and even in countries where they still execute gays for being gay?”

Maria, “ya I said that’s BS”

Shefali, “ok I hear you, I’m not saying I don’t believe you... but why do you think it’s BS?”

Maria, “well they said so on CNN”

Shefali, “ok did they say WHY exactly it’s BS?”

Maria, “CNN says orange man bad”

Shefali, “ok i get it now, thanks!” (changes the topic, realizes her friend has a sever case of TDS)
(10:39 PM) Robert Seidl: You listen to both sides because you’re smart! And yes you’re 100% right there are tons of low information trump supporters just like on the left!
(10:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you do know Mia is Maria right 
(10:43 PM) Robert Seidl: More people need to look at politics issue by issue and logically lay out the facts and have a discussion. And perhaps most importantly they need to be ok with hearing opinions and ideas they may not have heard!
(10:43 PM) Robert Seidl: And yes I do
(10:44 PM) Robert Seidl: That’s who I thought it was 
(10:45 PM) Robert Seidl: I’m curious btw...
(10:45 PM) Robert Seidl: Did she attempt to offer a logical explanation for why it was BS?
(10:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: what do uou think 
(10:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you 
(10:46 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha
(10:46 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes!
(10:46 PM) Robert Seidl: ...
(10:46 PM) Robert Seidl: No...
(10:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but I asked 
(10:49 PM) Robert Seidl: Mia stands for “Missing In Action” referring to the left side of her brain 😂
(10:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(10:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Ooh ooh keep going 
(10:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Ask her “what has he tried to pass that takes away gay rights?”
(10:56 PM) Robert Seidl: Trump has made proposals which would roll back transgender benefits medically (paid for by tax dollars) and he has also been in support of states that are against men being able to use woman’s bathrooms simply because they claim to be transgender...

All of which I agree with and I still vehemently support gay rights to marriage and things like that etc. 
(11:00 PM) Robert Seidl: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FTwsMvFBGQY
(11:03 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(11:07 PM) Robert Seidl: Ok ok this is great
(11:11 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahaha I haven’t asked or responded anything yet
(11:22 PM) Robert Seidl: 1) there was a ‘report’ from a far left reporter, Jane Mayer, for the New Yorker who claimed trump said “don’t ask that guy (pence), he wants to hang them all” —- there is no tape of trump saying this. The White House said that that quote did not happen, and the press secretary said ““The New Yorker piece is filled with unsubstantiated, unsourced claims that are untrue and offensive.” 

2)if trump had said that (which he hasn’t, but he has said multiple times that his administration does not listen to Pence on issues of gay rights and that his administration has their own beliefs on them... Mia is literally conceding that trump wants to protect gay rights from pence having any say 😂😂😂. There’s zero proof it was said, but if it was, it would be in poor taste. So it would be a bad statement with a good premise which Mia should agree with... the premise being: don’t ask mike pence 😂

3)as mentioned earlier, Pences beliefs on gay rights have been openly disregarded in terms of the administrations POLICY. 

(11:25 PM) Robert Seidl: Just like this weekend where a tweet went viral saying trump said Kim jung un would be a better President than Biden.... only thing is, the statement was never made. But a lie makes its away around the world before the truth is able to whisper. So I guarantee that many of Mia’s friends also still believe trump said that. They never hear the facts when they come out showing no that was just made up by some guy in his moms basement 😂😂😂
(11:28 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha so I’m confused, Mia is mad at trump for listening to Pence while she is simultaneously mad at Trump for making a statement (though a fake one in this instance) that he will not listen to Mike Pence??? 🧐🤣
(11:30 PM) Robert Seidl: Did you see the video? It’s pretty cool actually and I wonder what Mia would say to it. 
(11:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: watching it rn
(11:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA

(11:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it took her 30 min to respond to the video
(11:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and this is what she says
(11:39 PM) Robert Seidl: OMG you sent it to her?!!! 
(11:39 PM) Robert Seidl: You savage 
(11:40 PM) Robert Seidl: She’s going to flip 
(11:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: did you see what she said 
(11:40 PM) Robert Seidl: Didn’t at first now I did....
(11:41 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahahahahaha
(11:41 PM) Robert Seidl: Ahaha Hahahaha
(11:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m actually screaming lmao
(11:41 PM) Robert Seidl: She literally proves what the guys in the video are saying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
(11:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(11:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: HELLA HUGE YIKES
(11:42 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh.. my.. god..
(11:44 PM) Robert Seidl: Ask logical questions and think with an independent brain and you must be a republican!  
(11:44 PM) Robert Seidl: Damn... I didn’t think she’d prove my point THAT MUCH
(11:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is really funny 
(11:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i love fucking with people to make them think i’m something that i’m not but the only time is better is when they reveal something about themselves that you never knew even existed 
(11:46 PM) Robert Seidl: Notice how if it was reversed and you or I were sent a video saying someone was walking away from the Republican Party we would just be like ok cool that’s your choice want to have a healthy discussion about it?
(11:48 PM) Robert Seidl: (To clarify NOT saying you’re a republican... but you’re definitely a free thinker who doesn’t march in lock step to any dogma)
(11:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i am not a republican 
(11:48 PM) Robert Seidl: I know! Hahaha you don’t need to tell me! 
(11:49 PM) Robert Seidl: You’re just shefali! 
(11:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you wanna know something gross that’s actually good
(11:49 PM) Robert Seidl: You’re just somebody who looks at each issue individually. 
(11:49 PM) Robert Seidl: Shoot 
(11:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m eating McDonalds 
(11:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but the salads are actually hype af 
(11:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Whattt...
(11:51 PM) Robert Seidl: In the spirit of open mindedness I’ll not hate until I try one myself 😂
(11:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(11:51 PM) Robert Seidl: Maybe it’s because it’s Estonia?
(11:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(11:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: apparently all European McDonald’s or great which is why we tried it
(11:52 PM) Robert Seidl: Ahhhh
(11:52 PM) Robert Seidl: It actually does look decent 
(11:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: wait a minute 
(11:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(11:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: for the past 5 years you have been screaming democrat 
(11:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: sudden change of heart??
(11:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i don’t think so
(11:53 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha Hahahaha
(11:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: a SCAM
(11:54 PM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
(11:54 PM) Robert Seidl: I’m literally dying 
(11:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: love her to death but i’m being played 
(11:55 PM) Robert Seidl: You should act like you believe her!!!
(11:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i did
(11:55 PM) Robert Seidl: Maybe it’ll present you opportunities to help her see a couple of different sides to things! 
(11:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m trying to maximize my entertainment 
(11:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: no she is very clearly 10000% democratic 
(11:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she can’t change THAT MUCH since i’ve been here
(11:56 PM) Robert Seidl: You could may say “I know you just like to look at each issue and take it issue by issue right?” 
(11:56 PM) Robert Seidl: Maybe*
(11:57 PM) Robert Seidl: You’ve got a “never trumper” in a corner now though... because to prove it she would need to be open to agreeing with trump on something if he did it and it was in line with what she said she supports.
(11:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(11:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also came home to this
(11:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: sweetness 
(12:00 AM) Robert Seidl: But she’ll probably try so hard no matter what to never agree... so get her on the record saying something like “if trump does some positive action for gay rights, I would think it was good even though I disagree with trump on many other issues.” She’ll be boxed in and have to agree.
(12:01 AM) Robert Seidl: But she’ll hate it 😂
(12:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if do it in person not over insta
(12:01 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ve done this probably thousands of times to people 
(12:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’d*
(12:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes 
(12:02 AM) Robert Seidl: That was Georgia right?!
(12:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah i brought her coffee earlier and then she did this
(12:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Awe 
(12:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Maybe she still really cares about you! 
(12:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah i mean i didn’t write her off i’m still normal with her
(12:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: even last night 
(12:05 AM) Robert Seidl: Good! My hope is she realizes she could have been less lackluster of a friend and makes up for it! 
(12:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah yeah she considers sophia’s friends equals to all of us (chubby, ninenke, and I)
(12:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Like she’s been saying that she wants to have a big dinner with everyone 
(12:07 AM) Robert Seidl: 🤦‍♂️
(12:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but ninenke and I don’t really care about the other people 
(12:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and would rather it just be us 4/5
(12:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also ninenke and I are really bad together 
(12:08 AM) Robert Seidl: Seems like maybe they’re putting pressure on Georgia not to hang out with only you and ninenke and not them 
(12:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: seems like it’s out of her will
(12:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Interesting 
(12:12 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂
(12:13 AM) Robert Seidl: People you laugh a lot with and joke a lot with are great people to be around 😁
(12:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay true 
(8:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: chandler got a full time job and won’t be coming to lolla because he starts his job within a week
