(11:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: in class
(11:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼would you have guessed she follows them??

(7:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 2 things 
(7:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 1. I accidentally signed up for a running class and it was surprisingly incredible 
(7:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you know when you feel like you’re radiating heat off your body
(7:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it gave you that feeling 
(7:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 2. so I thought the german left on sunday I was mistaken
(7:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: when I was walking home from the gym one ran into me
(7:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he bought me flowers??? and was like “so we are getting dinner at 8” ??? 
(7:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I clearly was like “lol no” 
(7:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s my story 
(7:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: have a great day!!
(7:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh yeah he told me to keep the flowers and I told him to give them to someone else he wants to get dinner with 
(7:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and then I said have fun 😂
(8:04 PM) Robert Seidl: Very interesting 
(8:05 PM) Robert Seidl: 😂
(8:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: dylan will be in STL this summer!!
(8:12 PM) Robert Seidl: Nice!
(8:35 PM) Robert Seidl: You accidentally signed up for a running class?!!
(8:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha yeah it was cool
(8:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it wasn’t just normal running 
(8:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was different types and different directions 
(8:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and some other stuff
(8:57 PM) Robert Seidl: Do you get academic credit lol or are you just saying at the gym? 
(8:58 PM) Robert Seidl: Sounds like you started to get a bit of the runners high 
(9:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: at the gym 
(9:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol yeah maybe 
(9:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it feels like it 
(10:50 PM) Robert Seidl: My friend sends me this video and writes at the top of it... 

“And this is why I’m MGTOW”
(10:50 PM) Robert Seidl: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5xUDsi4e0uk&t=3s
(10:51 PM) Robert Seidl: 😂
(11:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: wait are they actually debating if they would break up with someone based on the reason they cheated???
(11:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol do you agree that anal is not cheating?? 
(11:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and using a condom is not cheating??
(11:08 PM) Robert Seidl: Are you really asking me these questions??!!
(11:08 PM) Robert Seidl: 😂
(11:08 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHHAHAHA
(11:08 PM) Robert Seidl: I think these people are giant R Tards 
(11:08 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: THIS IS ABSURD 
(11:09 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes that’s exactly why my friend sent it and put his caption of “MGTOW” on it 😂
(11:09 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: “condoms are so out” 
(11:09 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: “yeah i mean it sucks but”
(11:09 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: shrugs shoulders 
(11:09 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: understandable 
(11:09 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: your friend^
(11:10 PM) Robert Seidl: I know I was dying laughing to myself (was in public soo lol) but don’t several of those things sound familiar to what I’ve said about girls today 😂
(11:10 PM) Robert Seidl: It’s horrific 
(11:12 PM) Robert Seidl: I will say it’s 1000% positive to be a total  freak in the bedroom with your special chosen someone... but ya these girls views on pretty much anything else are scarily accurate representations of many girls 
(11:13 PM) Robert Seidl: Notice how they’re like “oh we’re just better at cheating and girls are sooooo (with emphasis and repetition on ‘so’) shady” 
(11:14 PM) Robert Seidl: Also notice how the one confessed “girls just take that shit to the grave” 
(11:14 PM) Robert Seidl: And ya “it’s not cheating if you use a condom”
(11:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: both of them confessed that
(11:16 PM) Robert Seidl: When I’m trying to explain to you the types of girls who I’m phobic I’m avoiding (always to run the fuck away from them as soon as I realize), this is what I’m talking about 😂😂😂
(11:17 PM) Robert Seidl: This is 1000% how so many girls think (especially currently in college) 
(11:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol this is not new to me
(11:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is what i was told as a freshman when i didn’t know anything 
(11:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m just surprised people are STILL on it
(11:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: when they are in their mid to late 20’s
(11:18 PM) Robert Seidl: But it’s just the guys that keep dating them and reinforcing their behavior are either A) clueless on what these girls actually are like, or B) they’re 1 of the few that fully know but they just don’t give a fuck and still will date them 
(11:20 PM) Robert Seidl: Those girls are probably just out of college... the guys are the types of 30-40 year old dudes that loveee em’ some of these types of girls 😂
(11:20 PM) Robert Seidl: The girls in this are basically female versions of these guys. Truth be told they are perfect for each other. 
(11:22 PM) Robert Seidl: Can you imagine what things will be like when these girls hit the wall in their late 20’s (btw that’s my estimate for the girls in the video) - early 30’s.... at that point they’ll be miserable for the rest of their life and make everyone around them miserable too. 
(11:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: most of them are already doing it in their early 20s
(11:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: making everyone miserable around them 
(11:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they re never actually pleased in the first place 
(11:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: just bored 
(11:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: saying by their late 20’s is being toooooo generous in my opinion 
(11:25 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha yes you are correct... however, they still live in a fake gilded gold world because they’re still so many dudes treating them like princesses on account of their looks and promiscuousness only... hence why these girls won’t begin to notice the glass house they built until their looks begin to fade (and looks are everything for female sexual market value) 
(11:26 PM) Robert Seidl: There are* not “they’re”
(11:26 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i still think they realize as soon as they are out of college 
(11:27 PM) Robert Seidl: Also I can tell both of these girls look quite possibly below average without their second faces of makeup 
(11:27 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: because there is always another  better younger girl that is legal 
(11:28 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m just saying this because i’ve had girls like them tell me it
(11:29 PM) Robert Seidl: The smart ones do... and the average intelligence ones maybe subconsciously begin to realize but still can suppress it for a while..... and the massive lot of them that are dumb are hit by “the wall” extra hard somewhere in their mid to late 20’s
(11:29 PM) Robert Seidl: You’re right 
(11:32 PM) Robert Seidl: There’s a distinction though between them realizing there’s some girls out there who are younger and better looking, and realizing that all of the good attention they always received for no reason  was built on a facade and destined to evaporate.
(11:32 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya you’re right how’d I miss that “it’s not cheating if it’s anal” 😂😂😂
(11:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i don’t really care about the dumb ones tbh
(11:34 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if i’m talking about this kind of stuff it’s in regards to the more intelligent ones of the group
(11:34 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: sure their is a distinction but it results the same way
(11:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the girls stuff feel the same after time passes 
(11:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: right? 
(11:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lmao yeah that one seems legit out of all the rules they said 
(11:35 PM) Robert Seidl: The fucking cuck dude saying whatever to the girls that might cheat on him 😂

Also notice the guys citing their “experience” for being the reason behind them giving so much leeway... which is true that they have to give more leeway since they’re going to keep dating the girls that they are 
(11:36 PM) Robert Seidl: How do these girls think any guy in their right mind would EVER fucking trust them after saying these things 😂
(11:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they don’t care navies guys will still fuck them 
(11:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: because*
(11:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Exactly 
(11:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: for now
(11:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s been normalized 
(11:40 PM) Robert Seidl: Well if they are decent looking, guys will always still fuck them even until their 40’s (if they maintain themselves)... the reality of “the wall” hits them harder when the guys they ‘could have gotten before’ start going for other girls (who they used to see as way below them) instead of them. Their sexual market value stays high enough to always get laid (if they were decent looking) but not high enough to even keep any of the guys that they used to for any substantial amount of time.
(11:43 PM) Robert Seidl: Thing is, girls are so competitive... that the late 20’s-30’s girls will never tell the young girls the truth... because the old girls are trying to compete with them for the quality guys willing to settle down 😂
(11:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i mean if you are still fucking around in your 40’s......
(11:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i don’t think guys who date younger girls generally are looking to settle down
(11:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so if the older girls are trying to compete with them 
(11:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they need to all have the same goals
(11:45 PM) Robert Seidl: Generally guys that are dating girls (that are the guys girls want and compete for) aren’t looking to settle down 😂
(11:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah exactly 
(11:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so why would an older one try to go for the same guy
(11:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it makes no senses
(11:47 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol..... girls are no where near the same intelligence as YOU Shefali 
(11:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: sense *
(11:47 PM) Robert Seidl: They are always trying to be the girl that convinces the guy who was wanted by every other girl to latch onto only them
(11:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if that’s not what the guy wants in the first place you can’t just keep throwing that at him
(11:48 PM) Robert Seidl: Whether or not the guy is likely to latch onto them or not
(11:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: everything else will seem that much more appealing 
(11:49 PM) Robert Seidl: ^Yes you realize this but 99% are not going to act in a way that takes that into full account 😂
(11:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: stupid
(11:49 PM) Robert Seidl: Don’t shoot me.... but.....
(11:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Girls ARE NOT primarily rational beings. 
(11:50 PM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂😂
(11:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: bang 
(11:51 PM) Robert Seidl:  🚑 
(11:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 🤕
(11:52 PM) Robert Seidl: That’s the emoji I wanted!
(11:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahha
(11:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i don’t get how everyone doesn’t think of that
(11:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: all those girls do is sit around and talk
(11:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they’re bound to come one with this at some point 
(11:53 PM) Robert Seidl: And what do they talk about shefali? 
(11:53 PM) Robert Seidl: One word answer.....
(11:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: dick 
(11:53 PM) Robert Seidl: Wrong 
(11:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: themselves 
(11:54 PM) Robert Seidl: When they talk about the two guesses you just made it is always in the context of the answer...
(11:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: what 
(11:55 PM) Robert Seidl: Their “feelings”
(11:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: how could i forgot 
(11:56 PM) Robert Seidl: When they talk about dick it’s about how they feel about the dick. When they talk about themselves it’s about, well... how they feel 😂😂😂
(11:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i turned out everyone of those conversations 
(11:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: tuned*
(11:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 1.5 years of my life
(11:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: wasted 
(11:58 PM) Robert Seidl: Gee I wonder why you are less pumped about having your average gal friends than the average girl 
(11:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: no idea
(11:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i should go running back to them
