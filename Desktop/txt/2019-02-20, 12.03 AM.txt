(12:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼help lol...
(12:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol what?
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no idea... looks like i’m being recognized when I haven’t told anyone my name???
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: super creepy 
(12:12 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s not that... lol people do that awkwardly all the time... 

It’s what he said that makes zero sense if you’ve not yet spoken to someone in person 😂
(12:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it would have been that weird if he was part of the university of tartu group 
(12:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: because that was a closed school event 
(12:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i don’t even recognize this person tho 
(12:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol also funny how instantly defends preemptively against an accusation of hitting on you 😂😂😂 
(12:17 AM) Robert Seidl: There you go, looks like you have an admirer!  
(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so i’m in bed under the covers with my bra slightly exposed and a face mask
and evan just randomly walked in and flipped out
(12:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: So now he’s being 5000x more awkward like why wouldn’t you knock or something 
(12:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Don’t know who that is 
(12:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: roommates “best friend”
(12:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Because you want to walk in 
(12:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Duh 
(12:19 AM) Robert Seidl: In on something*
(12:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no he’s like already scare of me 
(12:20 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya that doesn’t mean someone wouldn’t try and pull one of those 😂
(12:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: there was nothing to pull he’s making something out of nothing 
(12:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I fucking hate them 
(12:20 AM) Robert Seidl: Shit why am I laughing I’m pissed 
(12:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she’s actually so annoying 
(12:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no it’s ridiculous 
(12:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: why are you pissed 
(12:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: since when do guys just walk into girls rooms with out knocking 
(12:21 AM) Robert Seidl: Because he probably did that shit on purpose 
(12:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also why can’t they just go to his place all the time
(12:21 AM) Robert Seidl: *because he did that shit on purpose*
(12:21 AM) Robert Seidl: You have every right to request that! 
(12:22 AM) Robert Seidl: Also it’s not polite to do that to the ladies room anyways... unspoken rule if you’re any iota of a gentleman to subject the guy roommate to it when possible not the girls roommate 
(12:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Can you imagine how I’d be to these people in person 😂
(12:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you would be HILARIOUS 
(12:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: his roommates don’t like him and i’m not mean to her
(12:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also his roommate never leaves the dorm
(12:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: im always gone 
(12:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I THINK I FOUND MY PLACE FOR NEXT YEAR
(12:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼￼
(12:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: one of these would be my room and it’s basically on campus 
(12:37 AM) Robert Seidl: Love it!
(12:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: which one should I do 
(12:38 AM) Robert Seidl: And to the roommate.. that’s the roommates problem. You can demand an equal split in the time spent between the rooms. In fact if he gets a bunch of alone time already then he shouldn’t have a problem with it.. and if he does tell him you’ll tell me and show him a picture of bald me 
(12:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Is the fireplace in the bedroom?
(12:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah lots of downtown houses have that 
(12:40 AM) Robert Seidl: For me I usually like better bathroom location 😂
(12:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’d get a little scared if I pulled up that picture my self...
(12:41 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d pick based off of which one had a bathroom
(12:41 AM) Robert Seidl: Hard to get a feel for the rooms from the pics
(12:42 AM) Robert Seidl: Are there more pics?
(12:42 AM) Robert Seidl: And you’re rooming with someone right? 
(12:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the room is just mine 
(12:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m never getting a roommate again 
(12:42 AM) Robert Seidl: I know the room is! But you have a suite mate?
(12:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m going to take the front room because it has the most light 
(12:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh idk who i’m sharing the bathroom with 
(12:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but these girls are from the sorority I was going to join 
(12:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they are chill af 
(12:44 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha that sorority girls usually = disaster bathroom 
(12:44 AM) Robert Seidl: No “that”
(12:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: my bathroom= disaster bathroom
(12:44 AM) Robert Seidl: Nahhhh

(12:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh I messed up your bathroom so much 
(12:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t even act like it isn’t true hahah
(12:45 AM) Robert Seidl: I love it when your stuffs all over my place... I much prefer it to your stuff not being all over my place

(12:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha I think psychologically that might actually be why I took so long to put it in a drawer 😂😂😂

(12:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahahahaha 
(12:53 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s the sound of someone exasperated and frustrated at their desire to squeeze something they desperately want to 😂😂😂
