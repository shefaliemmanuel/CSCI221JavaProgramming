(5:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: how are you alive 
(5:36 AM) Robert Seidl: How about the part where Joe says “haha you could put rockets on the back of the car” and Elon just flatly responds “yes.” Joe laughs for a couple seconds, but then realizes Elon agreed with 100% seriousness. 
(5:38 AM) Robert Seidl: That podcast was epic so glad I found it thanks to you haha.. I basically never look at my phone screen while working out... but I won’t lie I did several times to see their expressions and body language.

(5:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: “don’t do drugs”
(5:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and my dad goes “you’re not a teenager anymore your reckless years are over”

(6:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 1. I should have added a lol because he makes a joke about ANYTHING that could be taken seriously 
2. daddio mainly only spits straight facts 
(6:04 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol in his position to a daughter I’d say the exact same thing... but I’d be serious 😂
(6:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what a boring dad haha hypothetically you raised your child with good morals, so trust them make the right decision 
(6:08 AM) Robert Seidl: It would not be the daughter I wouldn’t trust lol
(6:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ????? are you implying you wouldn’t trust their source
(6:09 AM) Robert Seidl: I wouldn’t trust every single male she came into contact with 😂
(6:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: who’s to say the source would be a male 
(6:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol i’ve gathered you don’t trust males from your stories with your sister

(6:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: “slightly” HAHAHA
(6:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: fair enough robby 
(6:14 AM) Robert Seidl: And maybe it’s not me “not trusting” them as much as it is me “trusting what I know” 😂
