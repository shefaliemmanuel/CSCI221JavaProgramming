(5:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: How fitting is it that I was listening to https://open.spotify.com/track/4RVbK6cV0VqWdpCDcx3hiT?si=QjHLb9taScG5d6JNLMI97A when I read your message this morning
I might have gotten a little teary eyed, but i’m going to say that’s just because i’m PMSing

Specifically using the word “proud” means much more to me then most words (especially growing up with a tiger mom 🐯). My parents have told me they are proud of me a grand total of 3 times in my life
1.when I got into Stanfords Summer Program
2.graduating from an Indian classical dance school and becoming Sugarplum in the Nutcracker
3.winning the UN award/ launching anonymiT
You can only image the type of power a simple 5 letter word can gain when used on such rare occasions.

I say all this to explain how thankful I am for your support  encouragement throughout this weird process. It seems like such a big deal to me, but I’m sure it will feel like a tiny bump in a couple of months. This has mainly taught me how to remove my emotional self from situation and truly think rationally. I am so pleased to have been advised to surround my self with people like you in my life from a young age. Things could have flipped in completely different directions if I did otherwise.

Lastly, I had a company team meeting today (as I mentioned last night) and KM didn’t even show up to give her resignation to the team…. let the senioritis begin.
Regardless of what happens it brings me joy to have verified that the team stands behind me on what ever I decided to do from hear on out with the company. (Emphasis on the I part and not KimberMarie and I) After explaining the whole situation and being open to receive their feedback— it was assuring that they said they wouldn’t have treated the situation any other way and validated all the points I made. 

I mention the previous paragraph due to what seems to be an interest in this topic, but I would never want to burden you with any of this information. (Please let me know if I am ever doing so) It’s just like a small book that gets weekly updates.

Have a lovely night! Talk to you soon.
(5:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes I feel so terribly burdened lol.

Quiteee the opposite of feeling burdened... i love hearing about your your views on life, your passions, your hopes, your dreams, your curiosities, and your life in general. I’ve actually felt tons of inspiration from everything going back to that rooftop in Charleston. 

There’s no such thing as something you can’t talk to me about. The good, the bad, the fun, the boring, the crazy, the beautiful, or the ugly 😜. Especially since you visited St. Louis I can’t help it... but I want it all. I continue to only want more of you. I want all of you. 

But by saying I want all of you, I’m also saying that I want all of you being the you that you want to be. By saying I want all of you I’m saying that I want nothing more than to GIVE my full self to you, so that I can be a positive force in your life that helps you be that you that you want to be.    I know the only way to ever fully earn someone’s heart, either in a moment or over an extended period of time, is to be unafraid to give my own completely. I hope I never fall short of that, in this or in any relationship. 

You’re tremendously strong. I saw it right away. I can feel it. The kind of strong that needs to be unleashed on the world around you... because it literally has the ability to change thousands of lives over the course of your life. I would never say that unless I firmly believed and knew it. I know that you’ve always known this about yourself.

I’ve been very fortunate to have had some amazing relationships in my life... every single one has been different in their own special ways, but I can’t help but feel I may have been unexpectedly hit by something a little extra special. 

Night kiddo 😝
