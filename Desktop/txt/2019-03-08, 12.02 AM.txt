(12:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Big red flag lol
(12:02 AM) Robert Seidl: I was willing to kind of forgive it if it was chubby who came up with the coin flip as him just being distressed or in foreign territory.. especially given his past actions being so stand up.... but the fact that it was her just frightens me.
(12:03 AM) Robert Seidl: 🤦‍♂️-> to the “him feeling no need to confirm paternity” 
(12:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Bless his heart, he just doesn’t know what women are capable of lol.
(12:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Also would there be a way for him to confirm that the dr. concluded she was 7 weeks pregnant not just taking her word for it? 

Unfortunately it’s not paranoid at all of me to think of these things as they happen all of the time.
(12:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Anyways, he seems decided in his approach so it’s by no means necessary to bring these things up. 
(12:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no no I was thinking the same thing because he only knows what she tells him 
(12:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he sang actually been to the doctor with her 
(12:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he asks for my opinion on these things which is weird for me because i’ve known him for like a month 
(12:11 AM) Robert Seidl: If he was asking my opinion, I would DEFINITELY try to at least persuade him that he should get a paternity test just to be sure. The life and legal implications are too serious not to. 
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he didn’t say he was against it at all
(12:11 AM) Robert Seidl: Thank god 
(12:14 AM) Robert Seidl: The whole thing just feels funny with the way she’s gone about things and the things she’s said.
(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeahhh I wish them the best of luck 
(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it seems like they want it but aren’t really thinking it through 
(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also Id be curious about your thoughts on this episode 
(12:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(12:22 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh jeez that guy straight up twisted and lied about so many thing in the one I watched I honestly would have a hard time watching him again. There’s plenty of hardcore liberals or leftists who I’m happy to watch and dismantle but he’s another animal because he hides behind comedy and feigned comedy in the form of ridicule. 
(12:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂😂😂 I just like this clip 
(12:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(12:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Wait what’s the context?
(12:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: me too movement in china 
(12:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Is he a guy who identifies as a lesbian?
(12:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Ok. What else lol?
(12:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no it’s a girl who’s a lesbian 
(12:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: who was detained by the gov
(12:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she’s talking about her experience 
(12:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she’s a real life peppa pig
(12:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: with her “gangster mentality”
(12:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol love her
(12:26 AM) Robert Seidl: That is the very minuscule tip of the iceberg for Chinese human rights violations.
(12:26 AM) Robert Seidl: People have no, fucking, idea. 
(12:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you might actually like the episode 
(12:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: then 
(12:28 AM) Robert Seidl: I might if he actually goes in depth on China’s human rights violations because if he did everyone would be fucking shocked here. 
(12:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Fuck ya... the title is censorship in china. 
(12:31 AM) Robert Seidl: My mind might actually be changed on him.. finally a someone talking about China.
(12:31 AM) Robert Seidl: No “a” lol
(12:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I enjoyed the later part 
(12:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol this is the only episode i’ve watched since we watched it with mia 
(12:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Problem is at the same time he probably would support a social credit score of some form with penalties against “hateful people” and probably supports “hate speech” legislation which is simply a Trojan horse for government censorship. 
(12:36 AM) Robert Seidl: A lot of liberals are pro free speech and against censorship when it’s done to “one of them”, but think it’s not a big deal and the person got what they deserved if it happens to someone they define as hateful if they disagreed with their ideology.
(12:37 AM) Robert Seidl: If someone talks about censorship though, I’m interested. I’ll try and watch that episode sometime.
(12:38 AM) Robert Seidl: -on the subject of chubby-
(12:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya they don’t seem to be thinking things through. 
(1:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah he’s really happy about it so I guess that’s good
(1:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: his parents said he has to get a high paying job asap which totally seems reasonable...
(1:48 AM) Robert Seidl: I understand where his parents are coming from, however I still think it’s critical he wouldn’t give up on pursuing whatever he feels he’s meant to. I think one of the worst mistakes someone could make in his situation would be to take a job he wasn’t at all passionate about solely because of how much it paid him. 
(1:50 AM) Robert Seidl: He’d end up being able to better support his kid and be a better example to him anyways by sticking to what he knows he needs to.

(8:54 AM) Robert Seidl: She didn’t hear.
(8:54 AM) Robert Seidl: She’s out. 
(8:55 AM) Robert Seidl: I asked Ernie if he’d like to see shefali and his head perked up and cocked to the side..
(8:55 AM) Robert Seidl: (To be fair it’s probably just the tone of voice lol) 
(8:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂😂😂
