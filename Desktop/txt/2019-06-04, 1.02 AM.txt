(8:20 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: - write about 5 pages of re design
(8:21 PM) Robert Seidl: You’ll end up doing it great I know you will! Plus you’re the kind of person who would also know how to handle any worst case scenarios and deal with any adversity! So congrats no matter what happens 😁
(8:22 PM) Robert Seidl: Jeez 
(8:22 PM) Robert Seidl: That sounds brutal considering...

(8:26 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha k was 99%
(8:28 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahaha yeah
(8:28 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: how was your day
(8:29 PM) Robert Seidl: Welp, you can always just be like hey dum-ass (pun - I know he’s smart it’s just a pun) I’ll be on a cruise at this place during that time, so come meet me there for the re-sit. 
(8:29 PM) Robert Seidl: Jk
(8:29 PM) Robert Seidl: Good! 
(8:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i told him I would be in america to be more dramatic 
(8:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: bc if i’m i. europe he would tell me to fly back
(8:33 PM) Robert Seidl: The MBA program is kind of infuriating me because they had a transition of the deans and they’re being difficult on allowing me to take certain PMBA (night time MBA classes) and their new dean transition is a clear cluster fuck. The law schools been so much smoother in terms of clarity. 
(8:34 PM) Robert Seidl: Will figure it out though.
(8:34 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh shit 
(8:34 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: do you have your approvals from the past dean written??
(8:35 PM) Robert Seidl: They don’t seem to know what half of the last deans policies were 😂
(8:36 PM) Robert Seidl: And then it doesn’t help that I’m the only JD/MBA WashU student from my year..
(8:37 PM) Robert Seidl: So there’s literally no precedent or back up lol, but I’ll get them to go my way 😉
(8:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I know you will 😘
(8:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s horrible tho
(8:38 PM) Robert Seidl: That was smart telling him you’d be in America lol 
(8:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: do you know the old dean well??
(8:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahah yeah he asked me and I lied on the spot 
(8:39 PM) Robert Seidl: The old one was super gung-ho about me doing the JD/MBA.
(8:39 PM) Robert Seidl: But apparently he’s sailed off into the sunset lol 
(8:41 PM) Robert Seidl: I only had his WashU email but ya I was actually thinking about still trying to reach out to him (although I’m not sure of the circumstances of his departure —- for all I know shit went down and they decided to replace him) 
(8:43 PM) Robert Seidl: That’s a lie for your grades for something that you can’t really control and is mostly the structure of the classes fault... therefore I wouldn’t feel too much  guilt if I were you.
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: will have wifi in 15 min
(8:56 PM) Robert Seidl: I can talk on the phone for a little bit sometime after 4pm CT, but if don’t let me interrupt your celebrating!!!!
(9:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol for some reason I looked at my phone and saw it said 9 and was like okay cool can call now
(9:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: sorry about that
(9:01 PM) Robert Seidl: You’re good!!!!!!
(9:01 PM) Robert Seidl: I liked hearing your voice even though it was only for about 30 seconds 😜
(9:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahahaha me too 
(9:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I’m not sure what sailed into the sunset means
(9:03 PM) Robert Seidl: Way of saying retired / left / moved on to something else 
(9:04 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: If you knew him on a personal level I would reach out 
(9:04 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but that’s just me
(9:06 PM) Robert Seidl: I may, but it would likely be negligible since I don’t think he has much pull with the new administration, (and the two also don’t like each other it seems so there could be a backfire effect). 
(9:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahh I see 
(9:08 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I have no doubt that you can’t fix this!
(10:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼

(4:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: people clean it before they use it tho
(4:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Fake news 
(4:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Too many people use it and don’t clean it
