(4:19 PM) Robert Seidl: I. Fucking. Love it.
(4:19 PM) Robert Seidl: Well look at that, looks like you have a new calling 😝
(4:22 PM) Robert Seidl: But real talk, being able to speak other languages (I think you mentioned you already know how to speak Gojri or Ladakhi - or it may have been one of the other Indian languages lol) but Spanish is extremelyyyy useful in business. 
(4:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: let me add it to the list of the million other things I want to do 😋
(4:23 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha ik right
(4:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah 2 indian languages 
(4:24 PM) Robert Seidl: By 35 I want to be able to have a working knowledge of Japanese, Spanish, and Mandarin 😂😂😂
(4:24 PM) Robert Seidl: We’ll see if I’m able to make the time for that lol 
(4:26 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: my friend who goes to Amsterdam rn is moving to Japan after graduation so she’s been telling me about the learning process and it seems so hard 
(4:26 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I have no doubt you’ll learn those 3 by 35
(4:27 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya... ohayo gozaimasu 
(4:27 PM) Robert Seidl: Ummm ya unlikely to get all 3 but hoping at least one maybe 2 down 
(4:28 PM) Robert Seidl: I’ll definitely get much better at one at least 
(4:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: good morning to you too 😂
(4:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: do you already know a bit of each??
(4:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Since you’re level 2 your Spanish is probably already better or very soon to be better than mine 
(4:32 PM) Robert Seidl: Japanese I basically memorized some phrases lol that’s it
(4:32 PM) Robert Seidl: But I tried for the month I was there... often inducing laughter from saying something completely different than what I meant 😂
(4:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: for spanish you get a formula and you keep saying it with new vocabulary till it starts to sound right and then claim you “understand” it 😂
(4:36 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh my god you would look at it like a formula immediately 😂😂😂
(4:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I did the same thing when I was in China best way to learn it lol 
(4:37 PM) Robert Seidl: You’re not wrong though 
(4:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they use equal and plus signs 
(4:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: can you blame me
(4:40 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha
