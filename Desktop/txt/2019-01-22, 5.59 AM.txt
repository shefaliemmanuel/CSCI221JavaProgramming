(5:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i think kimbermarie’s mom passed away...
(6:01 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m sorry to hear that. How’s kimbermarie doing?
(6:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼this is all i’ve got but her social media is depressing 
(6:20 AM) Robert Seidl: Hmm. Have you given her a call?
(6:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: honestly she hasn’t picked up or returned a call from me in the past 3-4 months 
(6:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t wanna seem pushy about this 
(6:49 AM) Robert Seidl: Have you left a message?
(6:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i text her my message after 
(6:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Gotcha gotcha 
(6:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Would you like my opinion? 
(6:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes
(6:52 AM) Robert Seidl: There’s no right or wrong answer with these things. 
(6:53 AM) Robert Seidl: There’s nothing anyone can ever say to make them actually feel “better” in the sense of that person no longer having the pain they’re having from losing that person. They’re going to be having that pain, no matter what. Time is the only mender for that, and even then when it comes to losing loved ones there’ll always be pain there ready to come back. 
(6:54 AM) Robert Seidl: As her friend, the best you can do... is simply continue to be her friend. 
(6:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Just be continue to be there to be her friend like you’re clearly doing a great job of!
(6:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Perhaps give her another call, maybe in a couple days, (especially if you do know her mom has passed), and if she doesn’t answer again.. then leave her a message (voice mail) essentially letting her know how much you love her and how you’re there for her as her friend (those exact words aren’t necessary - what’s important is that she can feel it). That’s the best help you could possibly give her.
(7:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay sounds good thanks for sharing your opinion 
(7:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I know her mom really really wanted Kimbermarie and I to be friends for life 
(7:00 AM) Robert Seidl: I understand.
(7:01 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s tough when you’re the friend and you’d like to be there for her but you feel completely in the dark on what’s going on.
(7:02 AM) Robert Seidl: What mom wouldn’t want their daughter to be friends with you.
(7:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s alright well i’ll just try calling again soon
(7:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol idk prob a lot 
(7:04 AM) Robert Seidl: The message that I mentioned can be left... will be the best thing a friend could hear from a friend whether her mom has passed or not.
(7:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Feel free to call me for a few minute (I’ll have to keep it to less than 10 mins) 
(7:08 AM) Robert Seidl: *15 lol
(8:30 PM) Robert Seidl: Hope you’re having a great day 😉

(1:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Holy hell 
(1:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Sooo damn hot
(1:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Good thing my phone was in my bag when I looked at it at the end of class 😂😂😂
(1:31 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m dying 
(1:32 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m going to do terrible things to you 
(2:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god the quality is so bad via imessage i’ll have to air drop it to you
