(4:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol, I’d walk right back out the door and pat the other guys on the back and say, “lucky you guys, she’s all yours!” 
(12:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha sounds familiar 
(12:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but same 
(9:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Are you free at all tomorrow or Wednesday by any chance to FaceTime?! No worries if not though!
(9:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Yeah! I’m free tonight- Wednesday
(9:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I finished my cryptography for the week
(9:38 PM) Robert Seidl: Well shitttt
(9:38 PM) Robert Seidl: (And noice)
(9:38 PM) Robert Seidl: [intentionally spelled that way]
(9:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂 everything clicked 

I also found out today that this is actually a super valuable class that will look even better to have on my github (tech resume) for applying to grad school/ jobs in comparison to research
(9:41 PM) Robert Seidl: Fuck yes!!!!! 
(9:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: what they are having us build most cryptographers take a year or 2 to build 
(9:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and I figured out how to work the system (this class) 
(9:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so for cryptography majors it gives them a huge edge when applying, Bruno was telling me 
(9:41 PM) Robert Seidl: (If only you could only see how pumped up o get when I get good/exciting news about you)
(9:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I also have a new found personal interest in the subject 
(9:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so for computers science majors/ jobs (why typically haven’t even touched this stuff) it will be THAT much more impactful to have under my belt 
(9:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Bruno and I geeked about it for 30 min after lab 😂😂😂
(9:43 PM) Robert Seidl: Which ones Bruno again?
(9:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also Arnis and I are chill he helped a fuck ton and my code found a hole in his test case for our homework’s 
(9:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Bruno is Arnis’ (my professors) research assistant 
(9:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Bruno= grad student TA
(9:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Isn’t he the previously less helpful TA? 
(9:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ummmm kind of 
(9:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but he responds to my emails quickly 
(9:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the other TA is not helpful unless he’s in person 
(9:55 PM) Robert Seidl: Gotcha gotcha so he’s the more helpful one 
(9:55 PM) Robert Seidl: Was just lining it up with previous info 
(9:55 PM) Robert Seidl: That’s awesome!!! 
(9:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so Bruno is the Grad TA 
Ivo is the PhD TA
(9:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: thanks!!
(9:58 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol couple typos in the message you just reacted to but hey you’re a cryptography expert so you can figure it out 😜
(9:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha hahahah
(9:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: far from it 
(10:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but I think I can decrypt you 😈
(10:00 PM) Robert Seidl: To me you are 😜
(10:00 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh really? 
(10:00 PM) Robert Seidl: You think you’ve read my code huh??
(10:01 PM) Robert Seidl: And that you can program my love?
(10:02 PM) Robert Seidl: Well then in the spirit of cryptography since you claim you can decrypt me you must be looking at some fucking beautiful artistically programmed code. 
(10:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t need to read your code to duplicate it.....
(10:03 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahahaha i’m sure at some point we will be able to program the feeling of love with machine learning 
(10:03 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: cocky about your own code you haven’t written
(10:03 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: love it 
(10:04 PM) Robert Seidl: Honey... this code is can’t be duplicated...
(10:04 PM) Robert Seidl: My code is intrinsic... 
(10:05 PM) Robert Seidl: Programmed since birth to perfection 😂😂😂
(10:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: tell that to robo robby..... 🤖
(10:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: just kidding
(10:06 PM) Robert Seidl: Nah..
(10:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: (maybe in a couple of years.....)
(10:06 PM) Robert Seidl: I’m telling YOU 
(10:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: nothing beats the real deal 😍
(10:06 PM) Robert Seidl: See now it seems like you have been able to decrypt a little bit of it 😜
(10:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha
(10:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: this machine is learning slowly but surely 
(10:08 PM) Robert Seidl: You’re no machine. 
(10:08 PM) Robert Seidl: And you sure as hell cant be duplicated. 
(10:10 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: unfortunately that statement is momentarily true
(10:10 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: isn’t that crazy and scary at the same time

(10:11 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the second park (i’m not machine)
(10:11 PM) Robert Seidl: Isn’t it scary that you’re not a machine?
(10:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: maybe for you 
(10:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: can’t get guaranteed satisfaction constantly
(10:12 PM) Robert Seidl: Huh?
(10:12 PM) Robert Seidl: Soo confused from your last 5 texts 😂
(10:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: with a machine have a guaranteed outcome in every situation  
(10:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you^
(10:13 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha are you malfunctioning right now 😂😂
(10:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you get a variation in outcomes when a human is involved 
(10:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: NO omfg but I was yesterday
(10:14 PM) Robert Seidl: Ok now I understand 
(10:14 PM) Robert Seidl: I wouldn’t have it any other way 
(10:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: one of my professors wrote on the whiteboard a few weeks ago and said “I’ve made a typo already”
(10:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂😂😂
(10:15 PM) Robert Seidl: Thank god you and I aren’t machines. 
(10:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: why 
(10:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you would reach max utility every time 
(10:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I mean I’m glad just playing devils advocate 
(10:18 PM) Robert Seidl: Max utility all the time would be terrible. You are perfect in your imperfections. There is purpose and beauty in the struggle. That is what makes us human. 
(10:19 PM) Robert Seidl: Without the struggle you can’t find said “contentment” 
(10:20 PM) Robert Seidl: (As far as when you’re super busy and you wish you could duplicate yourself or be able to not waste time eating or sleeping I can definitely relate though lol)
(10:20 PM) Robert Seidl: And btw... I don’t think it’s possible to synthetically duplicate us and all of our exact feelings and emotions to where it’s really us... it will only ever be shells of us. 

I have no doubt that there were be attempts at synthetic duplicates, and the know it alls will think they’ve nailed it, and it’ll turn out they weren’t even close.
(10:21 PM) Robert Seidl: *will not “were”
(10:24 PM) Robert Seidl: There’s something special about humans shefali. Something special about the way we connect. Call it what you want.... soul, God, elements of sub-atomic physics we don’t understand etc.... there’s something special going on.
(10:26 PM) Robert Seidl: And just imagine the miracle of us having been naturally created... out of nature... out of star dust... and then arising to the level of conscious thought. 
(10:28 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol anywayssss... I’m very thankful you are you, and not a synthetic programmed piece of silicone. 
(10:28 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahha I am thankful you’re not a robot 
(10:29 PM) Robert Seidl: I mean... could a robot be THIS weird....
(10:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but I don’t think it’s good to ever think being duplicated by robots is unachievable 
(10:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: probably not in my lifetime 
(10:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but at some point 
(10:30 PM) Robert Seidl: I’m telling you... it still won’t be you...
(10:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHA robots are probably even stranger 
(10:30 PM) Robert Seidl: It’ll only be a perversion 
(10:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they can force them self’s to hide their thoughts 
(10:30 PM) Robert Seidl: No they’re not. They’re math problems. They don’t have free will. They’ll never have free will. 
(10:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they can have parameters to each action and one can set their parameters to infinity causing them to have no limitations 
(10:32 PM) Robert Seidl: You’ll be able to create scarily similar synthetics yes... but they’ll never be the same. 
(10:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but sure they don’t have innate  free will 
(10:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: NEVER is a strong word
(10:32 PM) Robert Seidl: Again... the parameters proves my point as it would have built in randomness or built in “false choice” based off of artificial intelligence my 
(10:33 PM) Robert Seidl: ^and it’ll never be even close to human free will. 
(10:33 PM) Robert Seidl: NEVERRRR
(10:34 PM) Robert Seidl: HAHAHAHA
(10:34 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: LOL okay?!.??
(10:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you can develop free will 
(10:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you can make anything 
(10:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you can replicate a feeling with a series of shocks i’m pretty sure
(10:36 PM) Robert Seidl: The mysteries of the universe and of us and reality are so deep and complex, that you’ll never duplicate an EXACT copy of the the human spirit, free will, and conscience. 
(10:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you can make robots that are able to give these shocks 
(10:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes yes yes I’m not disagreeing that you can simulate many many things synthetically!!!!
(10:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’re just saying they will be diff then the real deal
(10:37 PM) Robert Seidl: My class got cancelled 
(10:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s like you keep trying to reach perfection but every step closer is a deviation of the last one 
(10:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i get what you’re saying I just don’t agree with it 
(10:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i see your logic but i don’t think it’s the only option 
(10:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i think that there is a higher probability of it being the outcome
(11:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(11:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
