(12:40 AM) Robert Seidl: I got you! Lol I’d have no doubt you’d get the job on your own anyways, so the better strategy would actually be to get the job on your own first, and then be in contact with someone like that once you were already working there. 
(12:45 AM) Robert Seidl: Often times if you’re ever at a point when you’re 100% sure of what you’re doing, you can be 100% sure you should be asking yourself more questions at least until you’re no longer 100% sure. It’s not a good sign necessarily when someone’s 100% sure about what they’re doing all of the time.
(12:47 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d be worried about anyone who was always 100% sure. It’s quite healthy to not be 100% sure 😉
(12:49 AM) Robert Seidl: *Be 100% curious 😝
(12:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I just meant that I have a set primary plan. That being said, I have no problem diverting from the initial path just simply feel more comfortable that it exists (in my head lol)
(12:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: for a minimum back up plan
