(5:58 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re studying hard! You study so much harder than most people in college.
(6:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ve been useless today I took a bubble bath and have been watching tv
(6:10 AM) Robert Seidl: I bet it’s because you got one of or more difficult ones out of the way today and you already felt confident about what you had tomorrow
(6:11 AM) Robert Seidl: The important questions is, did you masturbate in the bath?
(6:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha both of my ones today were my harder classes
(6:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and I never study for stats tomorrow .... you can stop being right now lol
(6:12 AM) Robert Seidl: You did masturbate in the bath 
(6:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and no I did not I just kept getting knocks at my door 
(6:12 AM) Robert Seidl: See there you go I was intentionally wrong! 
(6:13 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha
(6:13 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol was it your female roommate? 
(6:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha yeah asking me to turn my music down but I don’t remember when this apartment turned into the library 
(6:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the other female one 
(6:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so I was going to be like “in the words of our other roommate ‘fuck no’”
(6:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but instead I opened my door and said okay i will try and shut the door 
(6:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also who waits till the last 15min to do an assignment
(6:16 AM) Robert Seidl: If I was there we could give them some noise 😂😂😂
(6:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god hahahaha
(6:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I want nothing more 
(6:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol ya that’s a good one because they can’t really knock on the door during or ask you to stop. And they know you know but clearly don’t give a fuck. And even worse if it sounded like you and I were having a good time they’d automatically be a little jealous. 
(6:19 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s literally a “fuck you” 
(6:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so i’ll see you tomorrow morning
(6:20 AM) Robert Seidl: But I’d never do that intentionally unless you really didn’t like them 😂😂
(6:20 AM) Robert Seidl: K!
(6:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha 
(6:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that would be horrible if it was uncalled for and very uncomfortable 
(6:23 AM) Robert Seidl: I mean, but if they were cool and / or your good friends and you just got carried away.... it’s kind of a thing where it’s supposed to not be a big deal. As long as you’re not *trying* to be loud and you’re doing your best to keep the session kind of chill.
(6:23 AM) Robert Seidl: There’s only so much you can do. Especially when furniture is involved.
(6:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: kind of chill 
(6:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i don’t think this bed gets that 
(6:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i don’t think my be
(6:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: good/ best friends would care honestly 
(6:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they’d prob just be happy for us
(6:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Exactly 
(6:27 AM) Robert Seidl: As long as you weren’t rubbing it in their face unnecessarily at a certain point there’s no avoiding walking out of your room and them not knowing you had sex lol
(6:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but just incase let’s try not to get into this situation 
(6:32 AM) Robert Seidl: Wait what no I was hoping you’d invite all your friends over to be in your living room while you and I have sex??
(6:32 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh lol 
(6:33 AM) Robert Seidl: The “oh lol” was going to be for something else but I forgot 
(6:33 AM) Robert Seidl: My brain is fried 
(6:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’re unpredictable so I just to just state my opinion just incase 
(6:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha mine is too
(6:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Now it’d mean even more to me if you occasionally mischievously start getting frisky with me while other people are around the corner... because you “can’t help it” 
(6:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: chilllllll
(6:36 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s the thought that counts to me Shefannie 
(6:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Robby I swear to God if you ever call me that I will never respond

(6:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha
(6:52 AM) Robert Seidl: I was like okayyy 
(6:53 AM) Robert Seidl: I read it as “you can decide to not have sex anymore but I’m sure as hell going to” 😂
(6:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god no 
(6:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s horrible 
(6:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t ever think about having sex with anyone else even if we stopped lol

(6:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: fair enough haha
(6:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that was so long ago lol
(6:58 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya I must really not have liked it to go back and thumbs down it 😂😂😂😂
(6:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: or maybe you need to chill out with your thoughts on having sex around the corner of other people 🤣🤣
(7:00 AM) Robert Seidl: You took it far more seriously than I did 
(7:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: because I was being serious 
(7:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Half of the time when I’m texting and coming up with hypotheticals it’s kind of like the land of Narnia
