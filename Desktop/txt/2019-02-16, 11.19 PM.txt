(11:38 PM) Robert Seidl: So last week did you hear about the Jussie Smollett guy saying two guys in ski masks in Chicago at 2 in the morning (when it was -20 degrees) attacked him saying “this is MAGA country” and saying racial and homophobic slurs and tied a rope around his neck. The next day all over the media is the headline “gay and black actor attacked by 2 trump supporters” or “modern lynching of gay black actor by trump supporters” before ANY evidence had come out (other than the Jussie guy’s word). People were talking about it and I was like you know the media should probably wait until the investigation is done. 

So Shocker: turns out all kinds of evidence is now coming out that it was completely faked. Apparently there might even be evidence he HIRED a couple Nigerians to attack him and stage it. 

Keep in mind obviously hate crimes happen against people of all backgrounds... but there have been soo many faked hate crimes the past couple of years it’s been ridiculous. For the life of me I can’t understand why everyone just throws common sense out the window and won’t just allow the facts to come out before they rush to push a narrative in the media.
(11:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my goodness 
(11:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I didn’t hear about that at all 
(11:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s actually horrible 
(11:49 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya, it is... people who make fake hate crime allegations (if that’s what this turns out to be) should go to jail. 
(11:51 PM) Robert Seidl: And I don’t understand how people still take mainstream media seriously. You’d think they’d try just a little to be more careful and do a bare minimum of real investigative reporting since they’re being accused of being fake news by trump. It’s like they’re trying to prove trump right. 
(11:53 PM) Robert Seidl: If it turns out to be fake though... they’ll just quickly mention it and move on right away. 
(11:55 PM) Robert Seidl: ^shitty thing about that though (and I think they know this) is that there’ll still be a bunch of people out there who will never see the quiet follow up report saying it was fake, and so they’ll still believe it was real... and it will falsely feed that fake narrative.
