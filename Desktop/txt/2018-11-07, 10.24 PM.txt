(10:24 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha, glad I could be of service 😂
(11:36 PM) Robert Seidl: I really should’ve packed you in my suitcase and brought you with me lol 
(12:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: a girl can dream 😉
(12:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also let me know when works best for you and I’ll prob be able to make it work!! 
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Greggory is working his full time job today, so he’s dropping the jacket off tomorrow (should I give him a bag of carrots too)
(12:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼￼
(12:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼￼
(12:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼￼
(12:19 AM) Robert Seidl: That last one is a good  picture of us
(12:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Wrap the carrot in the cash. That’ll really confuse him. 
(12:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I get that this is pretty weird, but nothing is more relaxing then smelling your shirt 
(12:53 AM) Robert Seidl: Why is that weird?
(12:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m smelling an article of clothing?? 
(12:55 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s not weird at all.
(12:56 AM) Robert Seidl: If it was the first time we had met... that’d be a little weird bahaha 
(12:59 AM) Robert Seidl: We’ve both gone pretty far into the weird (in a good way) territory with the way our feelings are  for each other... and I like it. In fact I’m all in favor for it getting even weirder if that’s weird.
(1:04 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol I just realized that this is what all of my communication with any girls I was talking to before I met you looks like now....
(1:04 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(1:04 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(1:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼lol same 
(1:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if I was doing this the first time we met i would have scared myself 
(1:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Wtf?!! Lol 
(1:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and warned you 😂
(1:10 AM) Robert Seidl: Is this person mentally ill?
(1:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I thought this was how all boys are???
(1:10 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh. My. God shefali 
(1:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m kidding ahahahahha
(1:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I never get nice texts like “Hey how are you doing” from any guys I was talking to before 
(1:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha that is some next level retard shit (ya I know offensive to retards but necessary) right there 
(1:14 AM) Robert Seidl: I would literally block someone if they were that retarded 😂😂😂
(1:14 AM) Robert Seidl: (Not that you need to do that or anything lol)
(1:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no honestly he is blocked on everything except for text because he goes to abando
(1:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya one girl was sending me inappropriate videos a few weeks ago (after I hadn’t seen her for months). She then called me around 4am (after I had told her two months ago not to call me - I told her this 3 times). She’s now blocked.
(1:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Babson and Wyman wants me to go there 
(1:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so I ask him a bunch of questions about it 

essentially I unblock when I have questions and block when I don’t 
(1:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahhh I get that 
(1:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m sure you feel the same way but they are all cool people when they are not horny 
(1:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what a shame 
(1:20 AM) Robert Seidl: Umm..  can’t agree with you there lol.
(1:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh? haha okay 
(1:27 AM) Robert Seidl: When someone I knew (but keep in mind never dated remotely seriously - with these cases it usually was never even close to that)  continuously refuses to respect / accept my request for space, I lose respect for them, and I then simply remove them at that point. 

Lol I understand the asking questions about a school or whatever though, and I definitely understand guys liking you haha... but that dudes just creepy and desperate lol. 
(1:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I know it’s pretty fucked up, but it’s considered normal for guys to text like that 
(1:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: once I told him I was talking to someone a couple months ago and he still kept sending stuff like that was when I lost respect for him 
(1:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: now he’s kinda just a resource about info I might need or questions I need to know about 
(1:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya also it’s just very very bad “game” I guess if you want to call it that. I feel very bad for them because they’re clueless. 90% are convinced behavior like that (blowing up a girls phone repeatedly when she doesn’t respond) might work. I cringe at the neediness 😬😬😬
(1:37 AM) Robert Seidl: Funny enough on the contrary.. it’s literally impossible for you to blow up my phone too much 😂. If I just wasn’t able to check my phone for an entire day, and saw that there were 77 messages from you... I’d just be like sweet I can’t wait to read them all 😂😂😂 
(1:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s extremely pathetic, but (since i’ve legit spoken to guys about it) it seems like the ones who play on daddies money are extra convinced they can treat girls how ever they would like and they will continually flock due to their good looks???? 
(1:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: weird flex, but ok 😂😂😂
(1:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg don’t say that I legit will blow up your phone 
(1:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: with messages *
(1:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂
(1:50 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s true though. The important thing to me when I’m dating someone is just that they understand I’ll respond as soon as I get a chance. Sometimes that’s right away, sometimes it’s not.
(1:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: everyone’s busy 
(1:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: totally understandable 
(1:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think that’s a concept everyone should have about texting in general 
(2:05 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya don’t do the carrot thing lol he’d just be super confused / weirded out 
(2:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i think he’s malfunctioning 
(2:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(2:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha just laughed out loud 
(2:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Perfect timing 
(3:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he’s dropping it off in an hour 
(3:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: do you want me to ship it to you?? 
(3:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(3:40 AM) Robert Seidl: No don’t worry about it! I can get it back whenever I’m just happy i was able to find it. 
(3:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Love it. I might have to listen to that episode again sometime.
(3:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼nerds gets suspended from catholic school for doing this too much 
(3:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: “wanna know what goblins sound like shefali”
(4:05 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol now that’s talent 
(5:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: there’s your preview of a hackathon 
(5:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(5:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Thank you! 
(5:27 AM) Robert Seidl: (For the preview and the jacket lol)
