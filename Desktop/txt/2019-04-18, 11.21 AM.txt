(11:23 AM) Robert Seidl: 🐺 🌙 
(11:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wolf night?
(11:23 AM) Robert Seidl: You know how long it took me to find those emojis?
(11:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you know you can just type the word and it will come up as an option to tap on....
(11:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha 
(11:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(11:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Yup I was jk. I did that. 
(11:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh I was wondering how you responded so fast
(11:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Aren’t you proud of me?  🤴 
(11:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so proud of my wolf boy 
(11:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: basically, Jacob 
(11:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol
(11:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Truth be told I’m probably more of a hybrid between a werewolf and a vampire from that movie 
(11:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I was always team jacob....
(11:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Wolf body but vampire complexion and face 😂
(11:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’d be the only ½ vampire I would ever like
(11:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Would you do what the girl character (forget her name) did if I became a vampire?
(11:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Bella
(11:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Ah yes 
(11:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what do you mean 
(11:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: would I pick edward over jacob
(11:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if you were edward 
(11:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Not the choice I was alluding to..
(11:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh hahahha
(11:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what were you saying 
(11:32 AM) Robert Seidl: She has to choose on letting Edward bite her right?
(11:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes 
(11:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I would let you bite me 😂 if that’s what you’re asking
(11:33 AM) Robert Seidl: I wouldn’t want you to! 
(11:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he had to bite her for them to be together 
(11:33 AM) Robert Seidl: (I may or may not have slept through much of the movie..) but aren’t vampires like, bad
(11:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya but, I’d rather you not turn bad / evil then selfishly get to have you 
(11:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: It’s just like opposing sides 
(11:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not good VS evil
(11:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Ohhh
(11:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Man, so sad I didn’t pay attention more 
(11:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha hahahah
(11:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i haven’t read those books in ages 
(11:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but i didn’t remember it as good or evil
(11:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i could be wrong 
(11:35 AM) Robert Seidl: When I met you, I knew you had read twilight, hairy potter, etc. 
(11:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: how
(11:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i hates twilight by the way
(11:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: when i got done with the second book 
(11:36 AM) Robert Seidl: I figured you wouldn’t be much of a fan of twilight though 
(11:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i was like ugh i hate this but i want to finish the series 
(11:37 AM) Robert Seidl: You don’t strike me as one to resonate much with that mush  
(11:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ah 
(11:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah i don’t 
(11:37 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re too smart 
(11:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the entire series is a pitty party 
(11:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Hardcore twighlighter girls often tend to be basic AF 
(11:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ah 
(11:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: can’t disagree 
(11:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but it was more of a fad 
(11:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: idk anyone who still enjoys it THAT much
(11:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: maybe they are embarrassed to say 
(11:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha my age group there’s still plenty that are super obsessed probably because extra nostalgia 
(11:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ewwwww
(11:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: maybe I just pick not to know those people 
(11:40 AM) Robert Seidl: They were at that perfect demographic when it came out 
(11:41 AM) Robert Seidl: You WOULDN’T get along that great with those types of girls 
(11:42 AM) Robert Seidl: They’d also be super intimidated by your actual smarts too 
(11:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i haven’t ever gotten along super well with those people 
(11:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the interactions typically end with me questions how these people exist and being shook 
(11:44 AM) Robert Seidl: They exist because no more predators 
(11:44 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂
(11:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’d be surprised the % of comp sci girls that are like that
(11:45 AM) Robert Seidl: I wouldn’t 
(11:45 AM) Robert Seidl: There’s levels 
(11:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 80% 
(11:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they are all crazy 
(11:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and fucking weird 
(11:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: normally when I say that it’s a good thing
(11:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not this time
(11:46 AM) Robert Seidl: Just because someone’s comp sci or any advanced degree doesn’t make me automatically think someone is smart. I know far too many smart dumb people 😂
(11:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i wasn’t talking about if they are smart 
(11:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: emotional maturity and intelligence have no relation do academic maturity 
(11:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and intelligence 
(11:48 AM) Robert Seidl: I had met a few other comp sci girls. Most of them were quite weird... and not in good ways just like you’re saying 😂
(11:49 AM) Robert Seidl: I was so surprised you weren’t weird in one of those not so great ways when I met you as you started telling me about what you did 
(11:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha most are 
(11:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: “you seem more like the premed type of student” 
(11:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: .....
(11:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂😂😂😂😂
(11:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha 
(11:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Most of those girls just scare me 
(11:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: because they are bat shit 
(11:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they would hack a guy for breaking up with them
(11:50 AM) Robert Seidl: 😳
(11:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha 
(11:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes I certainly believe guys need to choose their female hackers very carefully 😂
(11:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s the # 1 question after comp sci
(11:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but you didn’t ask
(11:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if i remember correctly 
(11:52 AM) Robert Seidl: What’s the number 1 question?
(11:53 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh
(11:54 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m pretty sure I just said it as a matter of fact statement that I was glad I could tell you weren’t that type... but I think you’re right that I didn’t ask 
(11:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(11:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Just stated it 
(11:54 AM) Robert Seidl: What’s the tech-y-ma-bob?
(11:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Is that your new ID?
(11:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Shefali you really haven’t gotten enough sun in Estonia....
(11:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s a blank one i’m going to create 
(11:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i wore a dress yesterday it was 60 degrees!! for the first time!
(11:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but yeah i’m like never outside

(11:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: was surprised you didn’t ask tbh 
(11:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just made you seem like you’re not insecure 
(11:58 AM) Robert Seidl: You didn’t strike me as a vengeful type. 
(11:59 AM) Robert Seidl: You would be if it was someone hurting a loved one but otherwise no...
(11:59 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re one of the ones above the fray 😉
(12:00 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha I’m not (sure I have my insecurities like everyone — but comparatively speaking) 
(12:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m not 
(12:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: too much wasted time and effort

(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i was just saying 
(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: would i be a bad friend if we didn’t stay in the same place
(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: relatively close yeah! 
(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but like different place ya know 
(12:42 AM) Robert Seidl: No, you wouldn’t! Not in the slightest!! Especially if you try and coordinate for him to be near! I’m 1000% open to an air bnb with two rooms or a room and then he could sleep on the couch! But it would definitely be a preference to not share a double bed single room (with no separate living room) in a hotel.
(12:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Ok shnighky’s now Reece and Rachael were saying they want to go. 
(12:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Reece seems to really want to go. 
(12:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Rachael has been saying for the past couple of weeks she wants to but can’t confirm. 
(12:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah i’ll talk to chandler 
(12:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he didn’t pick up
(12:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and YAYYY
(12:59 AM) Robert Seidl: And he’d bring Bella too of course 
(12:59 AM) Robert Seidl: She asked about you 
(1:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I expected so!! 
(1:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: awh that’s sweet what did she say 
(1:07 AM) Robert Seidl: That she really liked you and asked if we were still dating. I was like absolutely.
(1:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: how are they doing with college coming up??
(1:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Good I think! Bella is a year below him still but seems like they still plan on dating.
(1:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh yeah oh yeah 
(1:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: good for themmm 
(1:38 AM) Robert Seidl:  Honestly think they’re much better than the average high school relationship. I kinda like her she seems to have a really good heart.
(1:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wait that’s actually amazing 
(1:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: do you think they will last through college?
(2:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Maybe, it’s possible. I know one thing Reece will get no shortage of attention outside of high school so if he still wants to stay with her then good for him! 
(2:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omfg I just finished quicksand 
(2:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what a twister
(4:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Haha k I will def watch it
