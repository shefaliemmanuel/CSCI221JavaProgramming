(2:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she’s french 
(2:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha 
(2:42 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol most don’t (she probably doesn’t) but a  surprisingly large amount of French people are getting extremely upset with their government for forcing very pro European Union policies on them at the expense of the French citizens, and more and more are becoming pro trump... so it’s possible she doesn’t hate him hahaha 
(2:43 AM) Robert Seidl: But NOT likely

(2:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(2:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: jealous???
(2:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Don’t let her know if you don’t hate trump as much as she does but just ask her questions and see if she has any logic behind her hatred. Like... what specific policies do you not like? (See if you find anything behind her hatred other than feelings, assumptions, mis- characterizations, he’s a racist, he’s a nazi, he’s a sexist etc. etc.)
(2:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she doesn’t know what i think
(2:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Nope not jealous. I don’t salivate at beef jerky until I’ve tasted it.

(2:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha ok 
(2:54 AM) Robert Seidl: So she gave zero substantial evidence to why she hates him?

(3:03 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s literally the easiest, most unchallenged, pseudo political stance to take in all of modern history...

(3:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i believe you 
(3:22 AM) Robert Seidl: Student X goes, “I hate Trump”! And all of student X’s friends go, “YA!” 

Then X says, “Trumps a racist!” And again X’s friends go “Ya he is, like soooo racist!” 

X then suddenly becomes solemn, as if a tear might fall... and says, “Trump is such a misogynist.” (X’s facial expression simultaneously implying X is a good guy non misogynist who his female friends should sleep with). X’s friends wrangle their faces in disgusted agreement, while X’s female friends pat X on the back for being a nice guy non-trump misogynist.. vaguely implying if he keeps being a good  trump hater it’ll work in his hierarchical favor. 

Inspired by all of this  passionate agreement with him and approval for once in his life, X then finally proclaims in as loud of a spice girl  shriek that he can muster....“fuckkk trumppp!!!” All friends applaud, joining in the chant of “fuck trump, fuck trump!” 

X’s lays in bed that night with a smile on his face, having achieved all the affirmation and approval in one moment  he ever could have dreamed of. X finally BELONGS. X drifts off to sleep knowing that tomorrow, he’s  reallyyyyy going to hate trump.
(3:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: why did you have to bring the spice girls into this
(3:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha
(3:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Because by adding the spice girl analogy it goes from text from a fake news journalist... to  text Shakespeare. 
(3:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lmaooooooo okayyyy
