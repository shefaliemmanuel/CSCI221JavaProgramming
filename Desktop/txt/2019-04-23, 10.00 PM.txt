(10:37 PM) Robert Seidl: I feel 0% bad about that 
(10:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Ah!

(10:38 PM) Robert Seidl: You look great!

(10:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHA i translated it for her into estonian what i wanted 
(10:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and i showed her the length 
(10:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and she didn’t do the first cut until i said it was okay
(10:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she could tell what type of person I am
(10:40 PM) Robert Seidl: See anybody should know in Europe that you’d just have to take extra care to make sure they understood. Sophia probably just was like “do this” in English.
(10:41 PM) Robert Seidl: Not to be mean but not that her hair is going to help her appearance that much...
(10:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes that’s exactly what she did 
(10:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: someone told her estonian guys are alcohols and to stay away from them so that’s what shes blaming her singleness on now 
(10:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: alcoholics 
(10:44 PM) Robert Seidl: Ok actually I feel bad 
(10:44 PM) Robert Seidl: It’s not like she doesn’t know
(10:44 PM) Robert Seidl: I think lol 
(10:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: why do you feel bad
(10:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she also doesn’t want to go through the trouble of being in a long distance relationship
(10:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so maybe this is what’s best for her
(10:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Georgia and I are going clubbing in Tallinn this weekend!!
(10:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Lies 
(10:51 PM) Robert Seidl: She’d jump at someone who was interested 
(10:52 PM) Robert Seidl: Nice! I’m surprised you guys haven’t? 
(10:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah prob 
(10:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she thought chubby was into her for a bit 
(10:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i think
(10:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: honestly we were too but it’s because it takes 2 hours to get there and back and the last train leaves at midnight
(10:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and they normally start around 11:30
(10:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if he didn’t have a kid and stuff i think she would still think he’s into her

(11:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/22/politics/social-security-medicare-trustees-report/index.html
(11:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Social Security won't be able to pay full benefits by 2035 - CNNPolitics
(11:09 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol yup I’ve been telling people about that for over a decade and saying how we need to implement massive cuts. They’d look at me funny and say “nooo that can’t happen we’ve paid into it.” They’d also day that if anything we need more social security. Nice to see someone else paying attention. 
(11:10 PM) Robert Seidl: Here’s a scary thought: imaging OUR generation at elderly age, and what they’d expect out of social security. Do you think they’re going to listen to any politician that is honest as says social security needs to be overhauled? 
(11:11 PM) Robert Seidl: And* not “as”
(11:12 PM) Robert Seidl: Say* not day 
(11:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lmao my dad and I have been talking about this for a while

(11:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lmaoooo Aidan and I had a really in depth conversation about it freshman year
(11:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: was actually the conversation that sparked out friendship
