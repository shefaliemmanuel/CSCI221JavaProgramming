(4:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Idk.... We’d have to make an effort not to try to not to spend all day in the bedroom and get out and see each place enough.... but I think that’s a good thing that we’d have to fight that urge to stay under the covers 😝

(4:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol
(4:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Okayyy
(4:24 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m interested in hearing yours! 
(4:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol as you know I could  go on for hours on these things, so I’d enjoy hearing what you think!
(4:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what do you think I pulled away from it 
(4:31 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d like to just listen first!
(4:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Was your takeawayyyy.. that trumps address was that of a fear-mongering racist who hates immigrant children?
(4:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: my initial thought was how much a drastic change as such would mess up the eco system 
(4:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: of the people that is 
(4:41 AM) Robert Seidl: You mean eminent domain?
(4:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no umm not exactly 
(4:46 AM) Robert Seidl: Interesting
(4:46 AM) Robert Seidl: What are you thinking about?
(4:47 AM) Robert Seidl: What eco system specifically and what effects?
(4:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: my impression is that these illegal immigrants have come to serve a purpose in society 
(4:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: extracting them quickly could be problematic 
(4:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: even if that purpose may not be completely positive or negative 
(4:54 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re right. 

It’d be extremely problematic for the human trafficking trade. 

It’d be extremely problematic for companies who rely on paying below minimum wage to illegal immigrants —- they’d be forced to hire more Americans below or at the poverty level who were looking for work. 

It’d be extremely problematic for the cartels and their various business interests / banks. 

It’d be extremely problematic for gangs who in the US that rely on the open borders. 
(4:59 AM) Robert Seidl: Were you thinking of some other effects specifically?
(5:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol feel free to just call me around 10!
(5:02 AM) Robert Seidl: CT!
(5:45 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼Nancy Pelosi and chuck Schumer in their response reminded me of American Gothic 😂
(6:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god toooo real 
(6:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he’s savage af 
(6:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha I hope you mean grant wood, and not chuck Schumer...
(6:03 AM) Robert Seidl: If you meant Nancy Pelosi, then I guess that makes sense..
