(7:27 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so Marlon is super upset with out BPM class since no one shows up. and that‚Äôs why the exam was so difficult 
(8:56 PM) Robert Seidl: Ahhh that makes sense. Understandable. 
(10:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ill be up tonight packing if you would like to talk
(10:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: at some point
(1:10 AM) Robert Seidl: Will call soon if you‚Äôre still up! 
(3:05 AM) Robert Seidl: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AyZNLOHPk2E&t=8s
(3:05 AM) Robert Seidl: Forgot to send this to you and figured I would since he hasn‚Äôt answered yet
(3:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: IVE SEEN IT
(3:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: before ahaha
(3:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Should have know 
(3:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Known*
(3:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: thank you tho üòò
(1:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Ôøºhe says many thanks 
(7:58 PM) Robert Seidl: Ok good glad it came through
(8:33 PM) Robert Seidl: ÔøºWhat the hell..
(8:34 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I just watched her black mirror episode 
(8:34 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: disappointing 
(8:36 PM) Robert Seidl: This really gross. What in the fuck is up with girls worshipping / glorifying abortion? 
(8:37 PM) Robert Seidl: The black mirror episode wasn‚Äôt good?
(8:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it‚Äôs a way for them to execute dominance over their own body 
(8:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: making them feel powerful 
(8:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes black mirror episode wasn‚Äôt really black mirror ish for some reason
(8:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: seemed a bit ordinary 
(8:38 PM) Robert Seidl: I think you hit the nail on the head... it is rooted in insecurity and the desire for power. 
(8:39 PM) Robert Seidl: Notice in late term abortions and live birth abortions cases it is power being exercised also over a completely helpless and defenseless person. 
(8:40 PM) Robert Seidl: The argument of ‚Äúit‚Äôs my body I can do what I  want‚Äù cracks me up.
(8:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don‚Äôt agree with them, but I also don‚Äôt think the government should be making these decisions 
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if you meet those mothers who have done these types of things they are not the nicest people ever 
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it might be a bit nicer to do something like what germany does- where you can have an abortion just don‚Äôt talk about it 
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it‚Äôs not illegal and it‚Äôs not promoting abortions 
(8:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but every solution has its pros and cons 
(8:48 PM) Robert Seidl: I absolutely think that  government should be allowed to ban late term and infanticide (born) abortions. I see the babies as defenseless humans at that point, and it‚Äôs no different than  protecting someone from being allowed to kill their baby. 
(8:52 PM) Robert Seidl: But to your point, Planned Parenthood is government public tax dollars going towards abortions both late term and born. 
(8:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: right right besides later term abortions 
(8:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I thought we had already spoken about that
(8:56 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes I was just confused by the wording since your text didn‚Äôt say that! 
(8:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: my ba
(8:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: d
