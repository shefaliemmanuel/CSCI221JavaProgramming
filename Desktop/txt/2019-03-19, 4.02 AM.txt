(10:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yikes rookie mistake I opened my laptop and your texts were up and my screen was frozen on your texts and everyone form my class was sitting behind me on my side of my laptop where the links were ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚
(11:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also the university of tartu gym is giving a stop poke aerobics class ðŸ˜‚ they have no chill 
(2:32 PM) Robert Seidl: No....
(2:34 PM) Robert Seidl: I am so.. sorry..
(2:34 PM) Robert Seidl: I feel terrible

(2:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it happens 
(2:38 PM) Robert Seidl: ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢
(2:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if I thought it would make you feel
bad I wouldnâ€™t  have told you 
(2:39 PM) Robert Seidl: ðŸ‘Ž ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž
(2:40 PM) Robert Seidl: Only someone who NEVER watches porn would have that happen..
(2:41 PM) Robert Seidl: I shouldâ€™ve known to tell you!
(2:42 PM) Robert Seidl: I just never have I message open beforehand on my computer in class (unless I had something I really wanted to say to you), so I didnâ€™t think of it.
(2:42 PM) Robert Seidl: Just tell everyone it was a prank!
(2:43 PM) Robert Seidl: Maybe no one noticed... did you put it down quickly enough?
(2:44 PM) Robert Seidl: The thumbs down were on you not wanting to have told me! 
(2:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha I donâ€™t know if anyone saw 
(2:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: honestly I donâ€™t really care if they saw 
(2:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if they did it happened 
(2:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: iâ€™m moving on ðŸ˜‚
(2:45 PM) Robert Seidl: They might not have!
(2:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ehhh maybe 
(2:46 PM) Robert Seidl: ðŸ˜¬
(2:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: honestly I forgot about it 2 min after it happened 
(2:46 PM) Robert Seidl: Iâ€™m sorry sweetie 
(2:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: donâ€™t beeeeee hahahah
(2:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they might have thought it was us since they have seen you on my background and know who you are
(2:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
(2:47 PM) Robert Seidl: No they honestly might have if they did see it...
(2:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: HHAHAHAHAHAHA
(2:47 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh god I had to send you the fishnets one....
(2:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is actually hilarious 
(2:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: maybe I should take this more seriously 
(2:48 PM) Robert Seidl: No no no, itâ€™ll undoubtedly be hilarious to us later....
(2:49 PM) Robert Seidl: I just would never want to make you feel bad like that 
(2:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I donâ€™t feel bad at allllllllll
(2:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was my mistake 
(2:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Youâ€™re definitely having the right approach to your reaction.
(2:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: my laptop has never frozen like that
(2:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: maybe sebastian was shocked ðŸ˜‚
(2:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Plus the more you play something off like that as no big deal the less of a big deal it is to other people
(2:51 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha
(2:52 PM) Robert Seidl: Or Sebastian froze on it because he likedddd it 
(2:52 PM) Robert Seidl: God dammit Sebastian you pervert 
(2:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: or he was traumatized to see his mom in those positions 
(2:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I donâ€™t think anyone would even say anything to me if they saw
(2:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they know me but not that well ya know
(2:55 PM) Robert Seidl: It could be way worse too.... one kid at the citadel had that prank pulled on him and it was gay porn... and it was full blast volume that an army captain professor and the entire class heard. 
(2:56 PM) Robert Seidl: The whole class was laughing at him. 
(2:56 PM) Robert Seidl: The army captain just kept talking unphased 
(2:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yikessss yeah if it was playing i would not have been this chill about it 
(2:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but it was just a link
(2:57 PM) Robert Seidl: Honestly no one would necessarily think it was porn then 
(2:57 PM) Robert Seidl: Even if they saw a quick glimpse 
(2:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was also in Dr. Starrs bffs class so I would have actually kms 
(2:58 PM) Robert Seidl: I wouldâ€™ve killed myself so you didnâ€™t have to kill yourself 
(2:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: then we would both be gone ðŸ˜­
(3:01 PM) Robert Seidl: No one thought the kid was actually watching the porn they just thought it was funny... multiple people were like bro donâ€™t worry about it 
(3:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: now I kinda wanna know what they think they saw not gonna lie
(3:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: awhhhh bless his heart
(3:01 PM) Robert Seidl: Noo! 
(3:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: iâ€™m not going to do anything
(3:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: itâ€™s just a thought 
(3:01 PM) Robert Seidl: Trust me worst case scenario they now think you have sex with your boyfriend.
(3:02 PM) Robert Seidl: THEY would be embarrassed to act like it was a big deal...
(3:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ï¿¼
(3:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol @ last night 
(3:02 PM) Robert Seidl: Plus theyâ€™re European...
(3:04 PM) Robert Seidl: Plus it wasnâ€™t a video playing
(3:04 PM) Robert Seidl: Plus they easily couldâ€™ve not been looking at your screen at that moment 
(3:05 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol 
(3:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: everyoneâ€™s always staring at my computer bc they try to copy my notes since I wonâ€™t send them out to everyone..... lol 
(3:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but itâ€™s like so fine
(3:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: seriously 
(3:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i promise 
(3:07 PM) Robert Seidl: No it is fine.
(3:07 PM) Robert Seidl: Iâ€™m sorry though! I love you!! Gotta run! 
(3:07 PM) Robert Seidl: (No more watching porn in class though missy) 
(3:08 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha
(3:11 PM) Robert Seidl: ((Im not just saying that youâ€™re fine btw... you really are trust me))
(3:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahah I love you too!! Have a great day! 
(3:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol no porn on my laptop every again 
(3:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lesson learned 
(5:32 PM) Robert Seidl: Btw thatâ€™s happened to pretty much every single normal male at least one time or maybe more in their lifetime (where someone embarrassingly caught them looking up inappropriate things lol â€”- and even further than that Iâ€™d be shocked to hear of a guy who never had someone catch him doing more than just looking at said images hahaha)
(5:33 PM) Robert Seidl: (I got caught looking at such images... by a girl who was babysitting for my younger siblings ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚)
(5:34 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya and for the majority of guys itâ€™s probably upwards of dozens of times 
(5:35 PM) Robert Seidl: In other words... if anyone wouldâ€™ve judged you, it probably wouldâ€™ve been jealous or uptight girls 
(5:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ï¿¼lol @ charleston bandwagon 
(5:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the russian girls hahahaha
(5:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: good think thereâ€™s only like 5 of them
(8:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I have some TEA
(8:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: its useless information but I felt like I needed to follow up on the topic of Donut
(8:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so remember the other girl who would just stare at me because she liked donut
(8:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so they have been fucking for like 2 weeks (poor chubba)
(8:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and her best friend is an exchange student here too
(8:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so the girl that donut is fuckingâ€¦ lets call her P
(8:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: (she has a crazyy slovak name)
(8:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Pâ€™s boyfriend has been messaging her best friend asking about who donut was
(8:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: P is straight up LIEING to him
(8:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and apparently she did this on her last study abroad too
