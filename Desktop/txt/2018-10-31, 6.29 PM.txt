(6:29 PM) Robert Seidl: Is that what she lied about?
(6:34 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: to mention a few of the many things she lied aboutâ€¦ she said she loved math, however she was trying to pay me to take her stats test last week
(6:34 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she also claimed to have taken all computer science classes but sheâ€™s newly a computer information systems major
(6:35 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol 
(6:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: (CIS is computer science + business= if not the easiest major in the CS department besides computing in the arts)
(6:35 PM) Robert Seidl: Oy Vey 
(6:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she kinda sold her self out when I was asking her about information covered in other upper level CS classes and she had no idea
(6:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she legit said sheâ€™s taking her first 400 level CS course next sem
(6:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and next sem is her last sem of senior year
(6:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and starr knows these catalogs like the back of his hand so he was LOLing
(6:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Oy Vey
(6:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: chill out robby ahah
(6:37 PM) Robert Seidl: No you donâ€™t understand I just love that phrase ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
(6:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh ahahah
(6:40 PM) Robert Seidl: Even though itâ€™s based on nothing rational... a lot of girls in Savannahâ€™s situation would blame you for not getting in, and given what you described to me about her I think thatâ€™s very possible. So just be really careful because when people convince themselves of things like that they can be very vindictive and try and bring you down if you ever allow them to have any leverage. 
(6:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ï¿¼
(6:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ï¿¼
(6:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think im good but if she blames me thats her problem
