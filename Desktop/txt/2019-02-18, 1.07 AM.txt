(2:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Any thoughts about the video you just sent me?
(7:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I haven’t watched it yet it just came up on recommended notifications multiple times
(7:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Pelosi quite incorrectly asserts that a democrat president could now sign an executive order banning firearms as a result of trump signing an executive order in the form of a national emergency to secure the border. 1) Pelosi is forgetting about a little thing called the second amendment to the constitution, 2) there is long-standing precedent on constitutional executive discretion with orders relating to national security but not otherwise violating the constitution (see Supreme Court Case Youngstown v. Ohio), 3) there are over 20 executive order national emergencies still in effect (to the best of my memory) and over 50 have been passed (including by both bush and Obama — obama who famously said on executive orders and declaring national emergencies, “I have a pen, and I can use it.”) 
(8:00 AM) Robert Seidl: My prediction: the democrats will judge shop and challenge the national emergency declaration in the 9th or the 2nd circuits, it will then go to the Supreme Court and promptly be upheld as constitutional. 
(8:01 AM) Robert Seidl: (9th and 2nd circuits are california and New York — the two most liberal circuits respectively)
