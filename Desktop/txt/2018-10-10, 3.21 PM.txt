(12:32 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ll def trade make that trad for the more interesting, dynamic, adventurous, and strong Microsoft that crashes occasionally because the highs are fucking high... over my basic bitch what everybody else does because it’s “safe” and easier Mac..... 😂😂😂😂
(12:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Why not have Internet Explorer, safari, and google chrome altogether???? That why you can sometimes go slow, sometimes be adventurous (you know, like safari adventurous 😂), and sometimes have it hard and intense  as fuck (no idea if that applies to google chrome but it was worth a shot)
