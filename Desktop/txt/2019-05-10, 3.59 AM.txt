(10:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ham!????
(10:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Putin???
(10:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha I was just coming up with funny names too 
(10:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes!!! Tell me some of those weren’t funny as fuck 😂
(10:30 AM) Robert Seidl: My actual favorites were probably Bambi (which can be bambalina in full), moose, and baloo. 
(10:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: baloo is cute
(10:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Moon and Luna are ok 
(10:31 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s very cute. And funny. And original.
(10:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Great combo 
(10:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: zoya is different 
(10:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Zoya’s ok for her dog... I’d never use it though 
(10:34 AM) Robert Seidl: She really likes bambalina, moon, and baloo 
(10:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Screw it as far as trying too hard to make a feminine name fit.. it’s a dog... any dog has the personality to pull off a more non gender stereotypical name 
(10:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i feel like you normally get the best names when you hang out with the dog 
(10:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Xena was a little different kind of liked it (plus it’s mythical ties) 
(10:41 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d tell people it was short for xenophobia 😂😂😂
(10:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god HAHAHA 
(10:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Can’t you just picture me naming my dog some of those names 
(10:43 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂
(10:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yess lol you would have to much fun with it 
(10:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but your dog wouldn’t know so it would be fine 
(10:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what it meant
(10:45 AM) Robert Seidl: How about 50 scent and Barkley? 
(10:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 👎👎
(10:46 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂
(10:46 AM) Robert Seidl: That reaction is why they’d be perfect 😂
(10:46 AM) Robert Seidl: I really like Garfield 😂
(10:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 12/10 would NOT recommend
(10:46 AM) Robert Seidl: Especially for a girl dog even better 
(10:47 AM) Robert Seidl: In all seriousness one  favorite of mine is Moose (I stole that from somebody else who named their dog moose though)
(10:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but it’s a dog
(10:49 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s hilarious 
(10:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Picture me yelling out “MOOSE!! MOOOOOSEEEE!!! COME HERE MOOSEEEE!!”

(10:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Good 
(10:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I can see you doing that 
(10:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just not for everyone or every type of dog 
(10:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Definitely not for every type of dog 
(10:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Would have to be like a German 
(10:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Or husky
