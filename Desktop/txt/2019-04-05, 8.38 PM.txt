(8:38 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha —- look at the comments for that video...
(8:39 PM) Robert Seidl: (Hard to remember which boy exactly this is as I thought she was dating a couple)
(8:39 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol also that would be cool for like.... an 11 year old.....
(8:40 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya they’re morons 
(8:40 PM) Robert Seidl: I got kicked out of my study abroad because I got arrested spray painting public property
(8:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼HAHAHAHA I’ve got like 20 min break while my computer is updated 
(8:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: updating 
(8:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is the one who is 27 too and we were all in advance algorithms together (he’s really dumb) 
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: unintelligent but hard working*
(8:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the logic was “there is already a bunch of spray paint there so it must be fine” HUH
(8:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhh for kendall, this was the guy she was going to spend the summer traveling around Asia with 
(8:45 PM) Robert Seidl: Seriously I don’t know how girls get away with somehow thinking their “taller than me” standard is ANY less shallow and objectifying than a guy saying they want a perfect piece of ass. The way they get away with it (and no one calls them on it because god forbid you call out one of these bitter self entitled women) is by saying “I’m just more comfortable.” Yes you’re more comfortable because you’re too insecure otherwise and you’re a shallow cunt. 
(8:57 PM) Robert Seidl: Furthermore, she automatically limits the dating pool to less than 10% of men by saying she wants the guy to be taller than her... and then she wants them to be smart (which really for most women when they say that actually means “high earner financially”), so that narrows it down to maybe 3% if we’re being generous of guys, THEN she doesn’t want them to be overweight even though SHE looks like a beached whale, which narrows it down to maybe 1% being generous, and THEN she wants them to be caring etc. which narrows it down to maybe .5%, and THEN she doesn’t want them to be ugly which puts her at far less than that, and THEN she wants them to be single (which if they are it’s for brief amounts of time) which puts her lets be generous and say .1%. 

So, now that we’ve established we are  talking about less than   .1% of men that she would even CONSIDER dating.... WHAT IN GODS NAME possesses her to think that a single one of those guys WOULD EVER be so much of a fucking idiot to date the selfish, snobby (mentions her PHD a solid several times), loose (you can tell just talking to her she’s been on the cock carousel), ugly, cringingly annoying voiced, completely non self aware, narcissistic, entitled whale of a woman she is..... 😂😂😂😂😂😂 
(8:58 PM) Robert Seidl: Geeee I wonder why she’s single and hasn’t been able to find any of the right guys to date 😂😂😂😂😂
(8:59 PM) Robert Seidl: The part where SHE complains about the fat guy hitting on her. Umm, sweetheart he was right on the mark and intelligently shooting in his league. 😂😂😂
(9:06 PM) Robert Seidl: I would be likely to self inflict serious bodily harm on myself in less than 5 minutes if I had to listen this varmint in person 
(9:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: THAT WAS SO UNNECESSARY FOR HER TO MENTION 
(9:06 PM) Robert Seidl: She’s evil 
(9:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: why was that a TTalk 
(9:06 PM) Robert Seidl: Plain and simple 
(9:07 PM) Robert Seidl: She was always miserable 
(9:07 PM) Robert Seidl: Will always be miserable 
(9:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was mad depressing 
(9:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: felt like I was talking to Sophia 
(9:07 PM) Robert Seidl: And will always make whoever is enough of an idiot to be around her miserable 
(9:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh btw I told her to try masturbating 
(9:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: might help her chill the fuck out
(9:08 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: well sophia doesn’t talk like that because she’s never had any experiences 
(9:08 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but if she had that’s what I imagine she would sound like 
(9:09 PM) Robert Seidl: Most woman today are utterly delusional, and when they get into their 30’s there will be countless women FREAKING OUT realizing their sexual market value is far worse than it used to be and they won’t be able to keep any of the guys the want for more than a short fling.
(9:10 PM) Robert Seidl: To make matters worse more and more men are utter pussies with no drive and no spine 
(9:10 PM) Robert Seidl: It’s a vicious cycle 
(9:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Georgia sent a picture of Italy today and ya know all of us were like wow so pretty and Sophia said “cant wait to visit and see this in person”
(9:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and georgia only responded to my comment and was like “excited for you to visit” 
(9:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 🥶🥶🥶
(9:14 PM) Robert Seidl: Ouch 
(9:14 PM) Robert Seidl: Feel bad for her 
(9:14 PM) Robert Seidl: But it’s her responsibility to figure these things out 
(9:14 PM) Robert Seidl: And make changes 
(9:15 PM) Robert Seidl: And she won’t 
(9:15 PM) Robert Seidl: So it’ll just be a sad story
(9:15 PM) Robert Seidl: Period. 
(9:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: well nicks girlfriend is visiting and some girls he’s done stuff with during his time here are going to the same bar 
(9:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: which is just lovely 
(9:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: SHES FACETIMING HER PARENTS RN AND TELLING HER FAM SHES GOING GO SPRAY PAINT THE BRIDGE 
(9:24 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and they were like but jail lol
(9:24 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and she goes “this isn’t russia”
(9:24 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I am losing my mind
(9:25 PM) Robert Seidl: K lol hate to say it but natural selection would’ve gotten rid of them without modern societies bubble rap 
(9:25 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: her mom just said please be careful 
(9:26 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: chubby and I were both like “fuck no”
(9:26 PM) Robert Seidl: 🤦‍♂️
(9:26 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: at least they knew it’s what we would say ahead of time
(9:26 PM) Robert Seidl: Who cares. 
(9:26 PM) Robert Seidl: Let them. 
(9:26 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: #thankful they don’t think i’m stupid 
(9:26 PM) Robert Seidl: You told them, you did your job. 
(9:26 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I’m the one they are going to call if they end up in jail
(9:26 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s why I care
(9:27 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they gave me a heads up
(9:27 PM) Robert Seidl: After that if they still do it the best thing for them would probably be to go to prison to re-evaluate their dumbassery 
(9:28 PM) Robert Seidl: Say, “no, I won’t. Because I already told you it’s stupid.” 
(9:28 PM) Robert Seidl: “So call your mom who said it was fine.”
(9:28 PM) Robert Seidl: See again further proof of NO ONE being able to take personal responsibility for their decisions 
(9:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I just told her to call chubby instead 
(9:30 PM) Robert Seidl: 👍
