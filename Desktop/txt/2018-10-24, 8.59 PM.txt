(8:59 PM) Robert Seidl: Damn that’s a hot Halloween costume!
(9:00 PM) Robert Seidl: ...I think you could definitely pull it off...
(9:04 PM) Robert Seidl: Especially if you and I were on each other’s shoulders 😜
(9:11 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha I’d do a Marc Anthony costume with you... although it doesn’t end well for the two of them 😂
(12:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha it would be soooo worth it 
(12:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so get this 
(12:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I just got out of that Student mentoring meeting thing right for the new startups 
(12:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and as soon as Dr. Starr said to talk to the mentors 4/ 6 teams immediately came up to me and were like pls be our mentor all at the same time 
(12:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they were like everyone wants you to be their mentor but you should be ours 
(12:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: definitely boosted my ego WAYYY to high 
(12:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: one team started begging 
(12:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: shit was wild
(12:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha well I’m not going to help bring it down... that’s epic 
(12:37 AM) Robert Seidl: I love it 
(12:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I felt bad for the other student mentors 
(12:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya was literally just going to ask about that..
(12:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: some of them are my really good friends 
(12:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but we’re all getting dinner tmr 
(12:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like 2 of the student mentors I mentored last sem
(12:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Ouch. Ya and even though you’re never the type that’d ever be jealous of something like that for a friend (you’d probably just be genuinely happy for them), reality is that most people just aren’t on that wavelength.
(12:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Good! Ya actually chances are even though they’re “mentors” they’re probably fine with it because they still see you as their mentor!
(12:41 AM) Robert Seidl: How’d you choose what team to help out?
(12:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Yeah when Starr was talking about companies progressing from mentors then met inside the class that turned into investors he winked at me and everyone turned around and looked which was uncomfortable and then he was like thats not always the case and looked at the company I mentored last year so idk if that was intentional but everyone noticed….He was almost like talking directly to me when he was saying stuff to the student mentors, so for the ones that just met me immediately started to not like me
(12:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Bryan and Karisha were super chill with it- his placed 2nd today and mine placed 1st but its like a fun healthy competition
(12:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sooooo when I came to speak to the class a few weeks ago they all kinda pitched their ideas to me and asked my opinion but there was one in the back with the same exact dynamic as what we had (they even sat in the same seats as us). Their developer is best friends with Chandler (friend with the dog Izzy) so I had actually met him over the summer but didn’t really remember him- we just started talking about it and it was crazy to me to see all the similarities between them and the og TOTEM team

TOTEM was kinda like the obscure company of the cohort and I later found out that so was Terrabase of their cohort: their vibe made me feel at home

but yeah basically people with a strong passion and vision, they are all so ready to learn
(12:56 AM) Robert Seidl: Nice! That’ll be fun for you! 
(12:56 AM) Robert Seidl: Did you talk to Starr afterwords? 
(12:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: nah thats these students time to have his undivided attention
