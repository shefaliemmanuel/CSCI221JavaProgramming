(7:42 PM) Robert Seidl: Did a little research into Hungarian custody law and child support last night. Was tough to find straightforward information and interpret, but seems like chubby is automatically on the hook for pecuniary contribution (vast majority of the monetary contribution) if she is the one who maintains physical custody of the child and she therefore takes care of the ‚Äúmaintenance.‚Äù So it could maybe be a situation where she literally just gets paid by him until the child is 18. Data seemed to indicate that the average pecuniary contribution as a percentage of salary can be up to 55%.
(7:46 PM) Robert Seidl: How‚Äôs he doing? He ok?
(8:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i was like oh I thought she was just a few? and he was like lol it wouldn‚Äôt be mine 
(8:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he told his parents and his dad got excited because he‚Äôs been waiting to be a grand father from his older sister 
(8:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they were debating abortion but 
(8:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he decided to flip a coin last night wanted me to decide head or tails to keep the baby!!!!! 
(8:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: a crazy person 
(8:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but it keep landing on heads aka abort 
(8:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and he was like that makes me sad 
(8:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so they are keeping the baby and the actually met in a cute way 
(8:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they have known each other since november 
(8:06 PM) Robert Seidl: I think Hungarian law might disagree technically lol. It seems that if you are biologically the parent you are automatically entitled to parental rights and obligated to parental custody obligations. Soo he and she might ‚Äúsay‚Äù it‚Äôs hers and not his... but the law maybe says its both of theirs.
(8:07 PM) Robert Seidl: Which would mean that at any time she could change her mind on the ‚Äúit‚Äôs mine don‚Äôt worry‚Äù kind of approach.
(8:09 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol well at least he seems to be in positive spirits and his dads excited. 
(8:09 PM) Robert Seidl: I would‚Äôve refused to participate in that coin flip.
(8:10 PM) Robert Seidl: That‚Äôs insane. 
(8:10 PM) Robert Seidl: Hmm.. he was doing a coin flip over that? Are you sure he‚Äôs ok?
(8:12 PM) Robert Seidl: (Also probably no need to worry him about the legalities)
(8:14 PM) Robert Seidl: However if he agrees to being the parent from the beginning or she says he‚Äôs the father on the birth certificate and he doesn‚Äôt contest it I wonder what Hungarian law would say about him then being considered a parent from that point on regardless of biology. (Some places do that where if it‚Äôs on the birth certificate at the start you can‚Äôt change it)
(8:15 PM) Robert Seidl: Did he mention any desire to confirm paternity or has he just decided to assume it‚Äôs his and not confirm?
(8:16 PM) Robert Seidl: (Also wasn‚Äôt saying you were insane for honoring him in the coin flip but that it was insane to do a coin flip over that lol)
(8:17 PM) Robert Seidl: Humoring* not ‚Äúhonoring‚Äù
(9:03 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Ôøºidk why but it seems like this whole thing won‚Äôt 
(9:03 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: send
(10:16 PM) Robert Seidl: The text is being broken up? I missed the 7 weeks pregnant part. Waitttt so that means it‚Äôs not his? 
(10:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: no no it is for sure his
(10:22 PM) Robert Seidl: I‚Äôm so confused 
(10:24 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol don‚Äôt worry about explaining it I‚Äôm headed to my next class. Hope your days going well üòâ
(10:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I did refuse to participate
(10:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I never said I participated, just that I was asked to lol
(10:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so basically he was under the impression that she was a few weeks pregnant considering she had her period the last week of january
(10:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: after her doctors visit 2 days ago, it has come to her knowledge that she is 7 weeks pregnant
(10:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: which is confirmation for chubby that he is the father
(10:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he feels no need to confirm paternity, but it becoming more and more common in Budapest with the younger generation
(10:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: this was all prior to his conversation with his parents that went well considering how excited his father was to be a grandfather soon
(10:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: his mother was not as excited but more realistic about raising a child when 2 individuals are in school
(10:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and how costly this task can be
(10:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: last night him and his gf were debating aborting the child or keeping and raising it themselves
(10:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she wanted chubby to flip a coin and make this decision
(10:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he wanted me to decided heads/ tails= keep/abort
(10:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: which I did not feel comfortable doing
(10:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the flip ended up on abort all 3 times he did it
(10:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but he realized that every time he would see that he got sad wishing it was on keep
(10:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so his decision was made to keep the baby
(10:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: additionally, I found out a bit of their background
(10:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they both live in the same dorm back home
(10:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she is part of (what seems to be the equivalent of) SGA for their Univeristy and was taking over for the person that knocked on doors asking people to vote for a few minutes
(10:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she happened to only knock on 2 doors one of them being chubby‚Äôs
(10:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they had the same friend, but somehow had not met each other before
(10:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: friends *
(10:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so that night one of his roommates asked him to get a beer- she was there with her friends‚Ä¶ they ended up talking till 6am
(10:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: next night same thing happens
(10:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they end up talking till 6 again
(10:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they start texting all the time and haven‚Äôt stopped since
(11:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they officially started dating around the last week of December/ first week of January
(11:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: sorry if that confused you even more üòÇ
(11:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: have a great class!
