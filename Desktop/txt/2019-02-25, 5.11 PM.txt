(5:11 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so Joe and Claudia are in an open relationship right— they were assessing their standings over the course of the past 2 months and have come to the conclusion to live together this summer…. however, joe has been hooking up with lots of other girls and claudia has hooked up with no one
(5:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: joe is under the impression that he it needs to become a closed relationship quickly or else there will be no recovery for the future of their relationship
(5:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he is not excited about this change although he just said I love you to her for the first time when he took molly this past weekend and she has been saying it for a few weeks now
(5:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: which is primarily what made him feel guilty about the whole thing
(5:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if someones initial reaction to a closed committed relationship is not positive simply because they are scared about “fucking up” during their last year of college
(5:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but they can see themselves marrying this individual
(5:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: what would you advise them
