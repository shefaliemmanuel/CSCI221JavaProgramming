(7:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Even if It’s looking like I’m going to have hundreds of gripes with it logically 
(7:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: entertaining right??
(7:28 AM) Robert Seidl: No problem 
(7:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i didn’t like the first 2 episodes 
(7:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Not like you’ve seen it already or anything 
(7:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was just weird
(7:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya but where I would’ve likely stopped already with the likelihood it’d just be plain bad... I’m not going to because you like it so I know it would at least be interesting to me and more than likely even addicting. 
(7:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: once i start a show i give it a couple episodes till i call it quits
(7:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it gets a little purgey 
(7:32 AM) Robert Seidl: I weigh whether or not I’m going to give it that chance.... you liking it is a very large scale tipper 
(7:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lmao it might not be your thing tho
(7:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you don’t have to watch it!!
(7:33 AM) Robert Seidl: I HATE the purge movies
(7:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i was kidding earlier
(7:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i know 
(7:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s why i told you
(7:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Do you just mean lord of the flies-y?
(7:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no their are guns 
(7:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: there are multiple weapons those kids didn’t hv 
(7:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya btw I’d obviously be going for the guns and ammo... before the food 
(7:35 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d already have set up a militia with the few guys (and yes potentially even girls) that I trusted...
(7:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Like Ryan bode, Marc straniere, and bob type friends 
(7:37 AM) Robert Seidl: The rest I wouldn’t care if they had their own guns.. I would just want to make sure that I too and the people I trusted had them as well so we could handle any tyrants sure to try and oppress others eventually 
(7:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i think they were less aggressive about how bad things would get in an amount of time 
(7:37 AM) Robert Seidl: I seriously think I would’ve immediately moved to do all of these things from about the age of 8 
(7:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Reece would too 
(7:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Wait so please tell me this is not like The Purge movies or I’m going to have to sit this one out...
(7:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not the entire thing 
(7:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i mean think about what these kids would do until someone’s in charge... every man for themselves 
(7:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: jk they start to travel in packs 
(7:42 AM) Robert Seidl: I should clarify... lord of the flies = interesting psychology wise and entertaining to me (the violence in that case is simply a product of nature - and I have no problem with that).... 

The Purge = unnecessarily amoral themes of violence just for the heck of it and because everyone is completely warped and perverted. 
(7:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: combine them
(7:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: well nothing unnecessarily happens
(7:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s just all out of fear
(7:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha I’m well aware of how these situations break down.. I study them and basically have been in versions of them 😂
(7:44 AM) Robert Seidl: (Obviously not as severe but still to the point where lord of the flies shit was going down on the reg - wheat was separated from chaff)
(7:45 AM) Robert Seidl: K I think you’re understanding what I was saying I hate about movies like the purge
(7:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: haha maybe a little
(7:48 AM) Robert Seidl: I can’t stand going along with the celebration of the  theme of having a day to violently harm innocents for no reason (and no the whole “it’s to cleanse society” does not rise to the level of a valid reason for me) -> that kind of thing is just vile and moronic (kind of gives me the same feeling as being grossed out by people who love slasher movies where the only point is innocents suffering)
(7:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i agree 
(7:49 AM) Robert Seidl: I therefore refuse to support movies like the purge with my own consumer vote
(7:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Humans dealing with real life human problems though.. is always interesting. Because 99.999999% of human history WAS lord of the flies type real shit. 
(7:52 AM) Robert Seidl: (Not that this will be accurate but interesting to see attempt at exploring human questions pertaining to such problems) 
(7:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s all i’m saying 
(7:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s entertaining 
(7:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: some of it seemed accurate 
(7:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: seems*
(8:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Truth is, no matter how much anyone studies about any of these things - nothing  can prepare you for how it would actually be if it actually happened. (In other words no matter how much I’ve read / studied I still have no concept of just how terrible and difficult it would be to live through something like an EMP (electro-magnetic pulse) that I’ve talked about.
(8:03 AM) Robert Seidl: I guarantee that whatever I’m about to see in this show... wouldn’t be anywhere even remotely CLOSE to how bad that would be....
(8:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah yeh they were much less aggressive about it 
(8:04 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol bet everyone’s hair and makeup stays on point 
(8:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: consistently 
(8:04 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂
(8:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and they all look clean
(8:05 AM) Robert Seidl: You actually do need to watch The Road with me. 
(8:05 AM) Robert Seidl: If I were to give my best educated guess that’s as close of a depiction of such scenarios that I’ve seen.
(8:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh i remember when that came out
(8:08 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol I could probably predict every conflict theme that is about to be explored in this show.. but don’t worry I won’t subject your phone to thattt bad of a texting barrage 😂😂😂
(8:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you probably could lol
(8:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: nothing seemed out of the blue for what they show happens
(8:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Shit I could probably write it from this point on (not to sound toooo egotistical) 
(8:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: go for it 
(8:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha I’d have to type my predictions not text — would take too long..
(8:10 AM) Robert Seidl: Depends on how long it takes me to fall asleep.. 😂
(8:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol ok
(8:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Right off the bat (and I’ve paused it this whole time while texting you and eating dinner #2)... I can tell there’ll be a “showdown of some sort between Will and the bmw driver.
(8:45 AM) Robert Seidl: Okayyy, to the moron that just pulled the gun on the tiny premature  group argument... I’d 1) immediately remove the gun from him by stealing it or by force when he wasn’t expecting it 2) gather support from other guys and 3) at the first chance lock the punk up (yes martial prison) for having clearly threatened to kill innocent people. And if he tried to hurt an innocent person or me and I needed to do so to stop him, I would kill him. The first people who try and act out like that in this scenario spread like cancer if they’re not dealt with immediately (this is why as short a time ago as the Wild West serious thieves and murderers were immediately hung without mercy - because without swift justice in isolated society, greater injustice  always swiftly follows)
(8:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Hope you have a great day today kiddo
(9:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Last comment: I’m 5 minutes into episode 2 and it looks like this show may try to make religion and property rights (capitalism) look as bad as possible. 
(9:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Seriously hoping it doesn’t decide to go hardcore with the virtue signaling 
(9:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: guess you’ll have to watch to find out
(9:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so what do you think so far
(9:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: repulsive?
(9:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: decent?
(9:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Cheesy AF 
(9:03 AM) Robert Seidl: So far..
(9:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol at its current rate — where I stand is I’d probably keep watching, but not want to admit to myself that I had watched it 😂 (which means I still could be entertained by it but not want to admit that I was entertained by it)
(9:07 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ve watched more than a few Netflix shows like that where I enjoyed them guiltily 😂😂😂
(9:07 AM) Robert Seidl: I mean..... 
(9:07 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ve confessed watching ALL of gossip girls to you... 
(9:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha yeah me too 
(9:08 AM) Robert Seidl: Or *most of it at least (did the skipping thing to end my binge 😂)
(9:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i would re watch gossip girl at some point 
(9:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Ok ya these kids are fucking retarded how big of a house you have means literally jack *%#*^** shit! It’s all about bare necessity resources and wealthier families often rely on eating out more and sometimes keep much less affordable storable food. 

Second they all raided the grocery store together. Some were dumb fucks and took Cheetos. But pooling ALL resources at this point would be wildly inefficient because nobody would ration themselves on how much they consumed (this is literally what happened to the pilgrims when they first came with “pooled resources only” causing them to starve to the point of even some cannibalism -> the next year the pilgrims instituted PROPERTY RIGHTS where each family could keep most of what they farmed and the next year they had a SURPLUS of food... which led them to have a feast we now know of as Thanksgiving. Imagine that?!)  

Furthermore not everyone in a town has kids of high school age there’s ALL kinds of empty homes and businesses that would have additional supplies they should immediately secure for community as a whole. 

Ok ok.. I’m done (otherwise you’d probably get 50 more texts like this in this one episode). I’m not going to be able to keep up with its fallacies 😂 
(9:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHAHA 
(9:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i. wish i could cuddle with you right now
(9:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha yup I am cuddling up..
(9:27 AM) Robert Seidl: With another girl...
(9:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: teddaline!!
(9:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahahahaha 
(9:27 AM) Robert Seidl: You got it 
(9:28 AM) Robert Seidl: (Ok she wasn’t on the bed but I now I just put her on the bed for you)
(9:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha 
(9:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: picsss
(9:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i wanna see the happy couple
(9:29 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ve pause and I’m going to shower, will send after around 2am
(9:29 AM) Robert Seidl: But then I’m cutting this episode short cuz it’s past mine and teddalines bedtime 
(9:32 AM) Robert Seidl: (Bet you never heard that TRUE story of thanksgiving in grade school or at CofC though)
(9:33 AM) Robert Seidl: (Would be a socialist professors nightmare to tell you the truth in it - but hell most of them probably don’t even know the true story)
(9:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: never spoke about it at cofc
(9:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: in class
(9:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: only heard it from christian teachers 
(9:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Right and it probably revolves around the pilgrims and native Americans being such giving people to each other.... but the part that is always left out is exactly WHY they had more leftover to give 
(10:20 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(10:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: my lever
(10:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: loveee
(10:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you look happy 😂😂😂
(10:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Well, I may be a butt guy... but I told tedeline what I mean by that is shape not size.. and that’s not good for her as she just hire has size  (we just got done talking about it)
(10:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Has* not “hire”
(10:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHAHA 
(10:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sleep tight sweetie

(9:08 PM) Robert Seidl: Wasn’t sure if you had heard about this.
(1:56 AM) Robert Seidl: Rachael just called me saying UT is looking better and better (they’ve been telling her they’re still strongly considering her). She’s been applying my alternative admissions methods lol. 

While she was walking she kept giggling and laughing at Gracie/Moose, who had just gotten her face all dirty. Don’t worry, I’m working on pics / videos (Rachael claims her data is full). Gracie/Moose sounded utterly adorable even over the phone 😂

(8:24 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha I don’t think I’d be able to keep you out of partaking in developing that app if I was working on it 😂😂😂
(8:25 PM) Robert Seidl: Imagine getting to fine tune it to every, single, dog breed 
(8:25 PM) Robert Seidl: (Which would mean getting to meet every single dog breed) 
(8:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: of courseeeeee
(8:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i think some might accidentally go missing and end up at my place
