(9:20 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya I know what you mean, I’ve been through this with hundreds of people. Reality is they just aren’t going to keep at it and don’t actually have any self motivating strong intention / determination. 
(9:21 PM) Robert Seidl: Unfortunately most people just utterly hate and avoid  uncomfortable things even when they know they are beneficial (like in this case doing an exercise which is uncomfortable or hurts)... and for them to change their life there’s only one person who could make that decision... them. They likely won’t reach a point of being a self motivator. So all you can do as their friend is give them positive tips and invite them along (as long as they don’t mess up your own workout too much lol) 
(9:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHAH I was voted to confront carissa about her loud sex and having sex in the kitchen 
(9:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and her smelling bad
(9:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so I did 
(9:23 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha nice 
(9:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(9:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and we were all sitting here and she turned red
(9:28 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh jeez lol 
(9:28 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: what can I say I always have the hang out bed
(9:35 PM) Robert Seidl: I feel kinda bad for her. Until you walk in someone else’s shoes you know...
(9:36 PM) Robert Seidl: She’s definitely been rude though lol
(9:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: there is no reason to constantly have sex ina 6 person apartment so loud that people are uncomfortable to come out of their rooms 
(9:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and people hear “fuck me daddy” when they are on the phone with their parents 
(9:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and she hasn’t washed her sheets since she’s been here
(9:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s long fucking time for someone who has sex in her bed a lot
(9:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also I’ve been told Evan is here more than I am 
(9:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also where we eat??? 
(9:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: really???

(9:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t feel bad for her which is why we said it really nice and respectfully 
(10:54 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya ok hearing the deets again wiped away any inkling of sympathy 
(10:54 PM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂

(10:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lineup just came out today
(10:58 PM) Robert Seidl: It’s fine to have sex all of the time, but if you’re doing it that much it is your obligation to anyone else living with you to work around their schedules when you can if you were about to have a fuck me daddy  bondage session, and get creative with finding other places. And they don’t even need to get creative they just need to use his room more. 
(11:00 PM) Robert Seidl: You didn’t tell me that the smell had gotten that bad.... I’d have flipped my shit and ripped her sheets off of her bed if she didn’t immediately clean them when I told her too....
(11:00 PM) Robert Seidl: That is Fucked. Up.
(11:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah if she doesn’t wash them tomorrow im going to wash them myself
(11:00 PM) Robert Seidl: She probably has all sorts of minor STD’s. 
(11:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: its not that hard and its like 2 euro

(11:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: im assuming the giant bottle of vagasil is hers
