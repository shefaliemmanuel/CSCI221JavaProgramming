(5:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: idk why he thinks this would work he thinks we are the same person which is TO WRONG TO EVEN START WITH 
(5:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is all just a fun game to you isn’t it
(5:59 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m just having fun with that last text and kidding 
(6:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if I did like the idea enough I totally would do something like that
(6:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if he wanted me on board he would have formally invited me already 
(6:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: thank god that ship has sailed
(6:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Actually the rest of it’s definitely not. I really want everything to go far better than even well for you in all things in general. And that is no game whatsoever to me!
(6:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i would rather kill my self than be part of “one of his LLC’s”
(6:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Would he have? 
(6:02 AM) Robert Seidl: If he was still hoping you’d offer? 
(6:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he has had many opportunities now that I think of it 
(6:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh no
(6:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i don’t plan on doing that and have made it clear 
(6:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that I am only here for verbal help 
(6:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not building the product 
(6:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I have separated my self if that makes sense i 
(6:03 AM) Robert Seidl: It does! 
(6:05 AM) Robert Seidl: I love you. And I love how passionate you are about everything you do. 
(6:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Going about it the way you are I can tell you treat everything like this. You pour yourself into it. Which is why you’ll continue to learn so much more exponentially than most people. 
(6:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I l
(6:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I love you too one of the specific reasons being the way you become so passionate 
(6:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like that fact that you haven’t met any of these people yet your so invested in conversations about them
(6:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i really appreciate it
(6:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol well, I won’t dance around it like Michaelangelo... I’m interested in everything you’re doing and that you’re interested in because I am very, very, interested in you Shefali Emmanuel 
(6:19 AM) Robert Seidl: I can’t help it, but if you’re passionate about something and talking to me about it... I’m going to be drawn to becoming invested in it 
(6:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol I hate my self for laughing at the first line 
(6:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow full name it’s getting serious over here 
(6:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: glad we can share passionss 
(6:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m sorry if I talk about this stuff to much I feel like we never talk about your stuff like this 
(6:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Well, I’m kinda in the hardcore study mode and frankly some of the material (especially law school) ain’t nearly as interesting to discuss on a daily basis 😂😂😂 
(6:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m down to talk about it if you are 
(6:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha ya?
(6:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ll try my best 😂
(6:29 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol k 
(6:31 AM) Robert Seidl: So, employee voice in a work setting as it relates to the law: commence lecture...
(6:32 AM) Robert Seidl: “Voice” is a form of self expression, basically crucial to any individuals self realization within the company, and forms a symbiotic relationship. 
(6:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Collective speech of a companies employees is necessary as a precursor to collective action cases.
(6:34 AM) Robert Seidl: As you can imagine, it is often the case that the employees interests in voice run up against the employers desire to manage and control their property and the details of their production process for example...
(6:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha 
(6:35 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s the intro 
(6:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Having fun?
(6:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg so much fun 
(6:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: tell me more professor 
(6:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂😂😂
(6:40 AM) Robert Seidl: I think at this point if I was your professor and you were my student... I might break.....
(6:40 AM) Robert Seidl: But it’d only be because I severely trust you 😂😂
(6:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahah what 
(6:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: trust me with what lol
(6:42 AM) Robert Seidl: With keeping it a secret until you were no longer a student 
(6:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha 
(6:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so down
(6:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: only professor i’d ever hook up with 
(6:42 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m extremely honored 
(6:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you should seriously consider that as a job 
(6:44 AM) Robert Seidl: Being a teacher / coach in some form has always been something I knew I was going to do.... just maybe not in the traditional sense. 
(6:44 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ll tell you one of my biggest dreams shefali 
(6:46 AM) Robert Seidl: To infect the world with a good virus, a good way of thinking and being, that spreads and spreads and spreads... and ultimately takes on a life of its own. That has always been one of my foremost dreams. 
(6:48 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha so another thing someone might say I should make sure I do: be leader of a cult 😂😂😂😂
(6:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wowowow a good virus 
(6:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’d be an amazing leader 
(6:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: even if it was of a cult lolol
(6:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: or just like leading literally anything else 
(6:51 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s part of what I’m actually preparing for. Literally anything else. Anything I have to. Anything I feel I can actually help with. 
(6:52 AM) Robert Seidl: (Again keep in mind this is all probably for selfish and somewhat egotistical reasons that I want to “help people”)
(6:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you have sooo many options to pick from 
(6:53 AM) Robert Seidl: Why pick? 😝
(6:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Not saying I’m not ok with focusing and directing my energy in a rational way though obvi 
(6:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t think it matters if it somewhat egotistical at all you’d still be achieving your goal of helping people 
(6:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha 
(6:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Lighting the eyes up in someone whose eyes had glazed over.... that definitely is one of the most fulfilling things I can imagine doing.
(6:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it seems like that’s been your true goal this entire time 
(6:56 AM) Robert Seidl: Even if I only successfully infect two people with my previously mentioned virus 😂
(6:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and you’re exploring different pathways to achieve it potentially 
(6:57 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re correct
(6:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is the only virus i’d every want to catch lol
(6:59 AM) Robert Seidl: Kind of esoteric and a difficult thing to explain to people who are wholly focused on one path they see themselves as fixed / stuck into. 
(6:59 AM) Robert Seidl: But yes shefali, that is my ultimate goal. And to do it to as many people as I possibly can. 
(7:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Even if it’s only 3 people 😂
(7:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i love it
(7:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so cool
(7:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Talk about loft though right 😂😂😂
(7:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i feel like your fan group for this idea would come from cosmic humanists 
(7:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Haha true possibly
(7:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Although ideally it’d be everyone 
(7:03 AM) Robert Seidl: I know I know cringe hahaha
(7:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol utopian thoughts 
(7:04 AM) Robert Seidl: Full human potential. That’s what I want. 
(7:04 AM) Robert Seidl: Ahhhhh
(7:05 AM) Robert Seidl: But the only utopia which can ever be achieved is within ones self.... the individual. 
(7:05 AM) Robert Seidl: Full human potential... for every single individual. That’s my goal. 
(7:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHAHA 
(7:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow you went there
(7:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya ya ya I know. You were eventually going to hear this but I love that you discovered it... that’s actually what I wanted. 
(7:10 AM) Robert Seidl: And the only way for the most net happiness for people to be achieved is for people to completely believe in themselves and their power as individuals, to make of their life whatever they want to, and to do it, and then to spread it. 
(7:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: why did you want me to discover it 
(7:14 AM) Robert Seidl: There’s many paths to going about this, but I ultimately decided that business was one way that can be very effective for doing it. Especially as an initial step. 
(7:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: how long has this been your thought for
(7:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha partially because it’s just so damnnn cheesy 
(7:15 AM) Robert Seidl: The core of it?
(7:15 AM) Robert Seidl: 5 or 6 years old 
(7:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sure
(7:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hummm I was expecting longer 
(7:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Seeds may have been there but I can consciously remember that being one of the very most important things to me that people could do at that age.
(7:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh wait i read it wrong
(7:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I read it as 5 or 6 years ago
(7:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol
(7:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Following the “why’s” and really trying to boil down what I wanted and thinking about it pretty much constantly. 
(7:20 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s like a sculpture that you have to keep forming and making. The core is there from an early stage, and piece by piece you refine and sharpen it.
(7:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what stage would you say it’s at now
(7:23 AM) Robert Seidl: There’s only one stage... evolution. Consisting of a constant cycle of creation / birth, death, and re-birth. It’ll also never stop, and there is no end... no ultimate hilltop to reach and relax on. 

But I wouldn’t have it any other way. The beauty is in the process, not a finite point. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.
(7:35 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼Have you seen this?
(2:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhhhh sorry I fell asleep last night
(2:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: no but wow I need to 
(2:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: have you seen it?
(2:03 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼￼they made memes of our advance algorithms professor 😂😂😂
(3:04 PM) Robert Seidl: Well you’re getting a nice and early start on your Sunday aren’t ya
(3:10 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: got my meeting witch michael al 8:45 lol
(3:10 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: with*
(3:10 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: at*
(3:15 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol
(3:16 PM) Robert Seidl: oh ya but don’t watch it save it we can watch it together maybe haha

(3:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he’s bringing winston!! will send pics if you want 
(3:17 PM) Robert Seidl: Wait, Michael has a dog????!!! Or it’s his roommates?
(3:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: no it’s his he doesn’t have roommates 
(3:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the other winston i’ve been talking about....
(3:19 PM) Robert Seidl: I didn’t know it was his lol. K well he earns a point in my book then 
(3:20 PM) Robert Seidl: Which gives him 1 point total 
(3:20 PM) Robert Seidl: I’d 100% fake friend him for his dog 😂
(3:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHA now you see why I can tolerate him 
(3:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: winston comes to every single meeting 
(3:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and presentation practice 
(3:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and just sits on me 
(3:21 PM) Robert Seidl: Soooooo jealoussss
(3:23 PM) Robert Seidl: I’d make hella meetings. If I thought they were improving too quickly on presentations I’d try and slow them down for more Winston time. Keep practicing team you have much more work to do while I pet Winston.
(3:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they take a lot of time because i can’t work with them all at the same time they need individual attention 
(3:24 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: aka more winston time 
(3:24 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he’s also mad distracting when he’s hyper 
(3:24 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: which is all the time and it messes with them presenting so hard
(3:24 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol 
(3:25 PM) Robert Seidl: I’d insist that he’s a good challenge to help them learn how to be focused in the face of distractions 
(3:25 PM) Robert Seidl: Dogs would instantly make me a bad mentor 
(3:25 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah but not when they still haven’t memorized their script....
(3:26 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: O have to ignore winston besides petting him otherwise I can’t focus 
(3:26 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I
(3:27 PM) Robert Seidl: I’ll take you and Winston on my lap please... although both each of you for very different reasons...
(3:28 PM) Robert Seidl: Both* is typo should not be there 
(3:28 PM) Robert Seidl: Not my Winston there wouldn’t be room for you then 😂
(3:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’d hope they would be for different reasons...
(3:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahhaha
(3:32 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya I don’t see you as my lap bitch..
(3:32 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahahaha
(3:32 PM) Robert Seidl: Get it
(3:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: fuck off
(3:32 PM) Robert Seidl: Like a female dog 
(3:32 PM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂😂
(3:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i fucking get it
(5:32 PM) e:: he plans on going to his job for a year and convincing some of them to quit and work on this with him 
(5:32 PM) e:: and he’s planning on giving the girls some equity from him 
(5:32 PM) e:: just not that they have founder equity
(10:38 PM) Robert Seidl: Interesting 
(10:38 PM) Robert Seidl: How was winston?
(10:39 PM) Robert Seidl: Shefali lol guess what my parents just found 100% on accident on their own... honestly this is really weird... 
(10:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: wait what happened 
(10:41 PM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(10:42 PM) Robert Seidl: Judging by the carpet they must be in the airport Bahahaha 
(10:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god 
(10:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i hate that they used the school of business since i’m not even a business major 
(10:42 PM) Robert Seidl: I never showed / mentioned it to them 
(10:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s so weird 
(10:43 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya lol 
(10:45 PM) Robert Seidl: I’ve bragged about you a lot as a person but not about that stuff lol. They must have picked up the cofc mag for Reece 
(10:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s in the charleston magazine lol
(10:46 PM) Robert Seidl: Ohhhhh Bahahaha
(10:46 PM) Robert Seidl: Ok very normal for them to have seen it then 
(10:46 PM) Robert Seidl: So funny 
(10:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so uncomfortable 
(10:48 PM) Robert Seidl: Not at all. They already would’ve liked you and the only reason they’d like a girl at all would be because of who she was as a person..... but undoubtedly they are probably super impressed Hahahaha 
(10:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahha oh my god
(10:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: btw he didn’t even bring winston 
(10:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and he told the girls things about how he felt and said i said them....
(10:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but they were like lol that’s not true at all based on her actions 
(10:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but I guess it’s cool that they read the article 
(10:53 PM) Robert Seidl: 🤦‍♀️ 
(10:54 PM) Robert Seidl: What did you say?!!! Did you correct him?
(10:56 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes I think it’s very cool
(10:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he didn’t say any of it in front of my this was when the 3 of them met this morning
(10:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and the girls texted me 
(10:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i will correct him if he says anything 
(10:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: in front of me 
(10:57 PM) Robert Seidl: 🤦‍♂️
(10:59 PM) Robert Seidl: No way a year from now he actually would still plan on giving them hardly anything hahaha 
(11:00 PM) Robert Seidl: lol and seeing your first job as a recruiting pool for your company you plan on starting is a seriously poor plan 
(11:02 PM) Robert Seidl: There’s all kinds of ways  companies can force employees into contracts where its be illegal or difficult for an employee to enter purely with the plan of poaching their talent base if they could prove it was the goal of his all along.
(11:04 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha it’s a nice little double whammy: my employment = my dating field & my recruiting base 
(11:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also most of the time tech companies make it illegal for you to develop anything while you work for them
(11:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if i wouldn’t have found a loophole in Apple’s paperwork  then technically Apple would own anonymiT
(11:14 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes exactly. The could have an argument that they own it even!!!!!!!
(11:14 PM) Robert Seidl: They*
(11:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so fucked up 
(11:15 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he was making it sound like it was michael and I VS the girls apparently 
(11:15 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: im mad pissed

(11:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 👿
(11:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😡
(11:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he didn’t bring winston again 
(11:17 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya I understand I’d be pretty furious at the collection of actions 
(11:17 PM) Robert Seidl: And that...
(11:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: pushed me to the edge 
(11:17 PM) Robert Seidl: ^traitor
(11:18 PM) Robert Seidl: (Not bringing Winston -that just crosses all lines 😂😂😂)
(11:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s what i’m saying 
(11:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m not kidding 
(11:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m actually upset winston isn’t here 
(11:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he’s the best part of these mentoring days 
(11:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: tbh

(11:25 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: respond to his ex*
(11:26 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha. Belittles them and treats them like crap... then immediately proceeds to solicit them for advice on his dirty laundry 
(11:28 PM) Robert Seidl: Is Winston there though now? Can you send pics?
(11:29 PM) Robert Seidl: I was expecting pics of the pup 😂
(11:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: honestly i’m almost started to hate him as much as I hate mason 
(11:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol I can’t hate someone without meeting them... but I strongly disliked many of has behaviors from the beginning 
(11:33 PM) Robert Seidl: Or maybe I could... it’s getting close because he’s wasting your time with his constant team drama
(11:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m screaming he can’t even tell that i’m pissed 
(11:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m not responding 
(11:41 PM) Robert Seidl: 🙁
