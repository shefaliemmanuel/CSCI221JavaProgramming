(9:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: (I know you have mentioned it a few times)
(10:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(11:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hey are you busy rn
(11:45 PM) Robert Seidl: At the moment yes, but can probably talk in like 20 minutes or so..
(11:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: nothing important just wanted to say hi
(11:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and that I miss ya
(11:47 PM) Robert Seidl: Feel free to call briefly after 515pm here 😉
(5:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 🐻 
(5:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(5:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(5:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: sooo sophia and I were discussing student teacher relationships and she’s curious about a COMPLETELY HYPOTHETICAL situation....

“I have no boyfriend to ask, so I have to ask yours to understand how boys think” - Sophia

- say I was failing a class
- the professor (male or female) was possibly sexually interested in me
- what are you thoughts on me engaging in sexual activities with said professor in order to gain an A 

(8:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha
(8:51 PM) Robert Seidl: I mean, hey if that’s what you want.. then who am I to judge..
(8:58 PM) Robert Seidl: However hypothetically if it was me who was in that position as a student, I would feel 1) that something like that was a complete degradation of myself 2) that it wasn’t fair to other students, unethical, and unprofessional and 3) that I would find any person in a position of power who was willing to make that exchange utterly repulsive as a human being. At the end of the day, what’s the difference between someone who trades sex for advantage and a full time prostitute? (If you’re going to tell her my PERSONAL hypo here then maybe make it sound a little nicer hahaha).

Hypothetically if I was a teacher, obviously it’d be extremely easy to abuse my status in that way... but out of principle I’d rather cut my own balls off than hook up with a student even if it seemed purely consensual and not a trade. 

It sounds like this may not be hypothetical for her, so maybe don’t tell her my personal opinions if that’s the case. People have the right to make their own decisions. 
(9:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼we need to play this
(9:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAAHAHAHAHA I love your answer
(9:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: completely agree
(9:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also have lots of TEA
(9:09 PM) Robert Seidl: You may want to explain to her that I’m probably on the vast minority for guys on that opinion 
(9:10 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I see 
(9:10 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I mean that’s the same opinion she got from me earlier 
(9:11 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m not surprised hahahahaha
(9:11 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but she is 
(10:53 PM) Robert Seidl: Shafiq’s all in on Lollapalooza... Said that up to 7 people can stay at his place. I told him you and I already had a place but we’ll have another great spot as a launch off point since he’ll be right near the festival 
(11:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay! 
(6:52 PM) Robert Seidl: AOC: “We need to act NOW on climate change!!!”

Republicans: “Ok fine we’ll vote right now on your proposed Green New Deal.”

AOC: “Whoah whoah whoah no no I didn’t mean thattt.” (Paraphrasing this quote but it’s basically what she said she said that republicans would try and vote on her proposal was just cynical).

Bahahahaha 😂😂😂😂😁 
(6:54 PM) Robert Seidl: The vote tally: 0 in favor, 57 opposed, the rest (all democrats) voted “present” which is essentially the same as a no vote but a way to save their asses politically and still claim they never voted against it 😂😂😂😂
(6:56 PM) Robert Seidl: It was mitch McConnell’s idea... and it’s perfectly in line with his nickname and memes regarding his nickname.. “cocaine mitch” 
(6:57 PM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(9:34 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼

(6:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lost wifi :( in the dorm last night
(6:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sorry sweets maybe tonight if you’re free??
(6:28 AM) Robert Seidl: No worries!
(6:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol *tomorrow sure I’ll at least have time for twenty minutes or so! I have a weekend class so hopefully I’ll be able to knock out enough work for it during the day 
(6:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Also... I’ve never, seen anyone do that with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
(6:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Btw speaking of bees from our last conversation... I’ve developed an obsession with honey being the one sweet thing I’ll have a little 
(6:32 AM) Robert Seidl: And it makes peanut butter taste sooo much better when you mix it in (that’s been my desert a few times lol I know I know I’m a weirdo)
(6:33 AM) Robert Seidl: *recent conversation 
(6:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Have a great day today kiddo!
(1:19 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh nooo i’m so sorry I couldn’t pick up last night 
(1:19 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhhhh I’ll ya have to bring you back some estonian honey 
(1:19 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: tallinn tech is known for it 
(1:20 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they gave us loads last summer in gift baskets 
(1:20 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: have a lovely morning!!
(2:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: doing a project of corruption in the business sector if you have any thoughts 
(3:34 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(4:24 PM) Robert Seidl: I have too many thoughts I don’t know where to begin on corruption in the business sector.......
(4:26 PM) Robert Seidl: Almost all serious corruption is tied to the government. You could do the 08 housing bubble caused by big banks working with the government who allowed them to issue sub prime mortgages
(4:27 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha you could do the Clinton foundation (it’s a business because it’s supposed to be a charity) 
(4:28 PM) Robert Seidl: Actually don’t do the Clinton foundation...
(4:28 PM) Robert Seidl: They kill people who piss them off enough... wouldn’t want that on your academic record 
(4:30 PM) Robert Seidl: Oooh here’s a really good really interesting one because it’s arguably the most corrupt monopoly in the world and the cause of countless wars in Africa to this day... the diamond trade 
(4:31 PM) Robert Seidl: De Beers
(4:35 PM) Robert Seidl: We’re talking controlling a plentiful resource throughout the world so well that you actually are able to con people into thinking it’s valuable.... we’re talking trillions of dollars over time. All the murder, bribery, and war you’d ever want in a business project on corruption. And it’s extremely interesting from an economics perspective due to how controlled the market for it is.
(4:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha don’t actually do this next one....
(4:38 PM) Robert Seidl: It’s too close to home... 😂... you could do it on the billions of dollars that Russian oligarchs and companies funnel into Estonia to what are basically Nordic controlled banks, and then funneled into the rest of the West 😂😂😂😂😂
(4:40 PM) Robert Seidl: You shouldn’t have asked me this question 😂😂😂. If I sat down for an hour to make a list of corruption in business, just off the top of my head you’d have a list of a few hundred possibilities at least 😂😂😂😂
(4:42 PM) Robert Seidl: (Those are illegal Russian dollars obvi) 
(4:44 PM) Robert Seidl: Obviously there’s plenty of perfectly legal Russian money and influence in Estonia and around the world.. but Estonia in particular is a loading hub for a lot of illegal Russian investments that want to reach the rest of the west through a middle man.
(4:47 PM) Robert Seidl: Pharmaceuticals is another biggg billion dollar corruption scam if you want something to really sink your teeth into
(4:48 PM) Robert Seidl: A quick example off the top of my head... Valeant Pharmaceuticals 
(4:49 PM) Robert Seidl: People also often pay several times more for the same drugs in the US as they do in Europe 
(4:49 PM) Robert Seidl: Many drugs are started in extremely unethical ways 
(4:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Ok I have to get back to my work 😂 love you 
(7:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they would just roast me for being from america is I did the russia/ estonia one 😂😂😂
(7:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahhaha I’m just supusto do a short general overview of the types of corruption. and how to fix it 
(7:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: only 2 pages.... APA
(7:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: basically only the bare bones if even 😔
(7:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: thank you for all the examples tho!! 
(7:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: super appreciate it 😘
(7:51 PM) Robert Seidl: Would be funny because they’re probably up on their high horse when they probably have never even heard about most of the corrupt things their own people do. 
(7:51 PM) Robert Seidl: But don’t do that. 
(7:51 PM) Robert Seidl: Also my class is today is coincidentally going pretty deeply into similar subjects
(7:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: most estonians think estonia is perf
(7:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: bc it’s the most technologically advanced gov 
(7:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol what are the odds 
(7:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: my french roommate just had 2 guys walk into her room with suitcases??
(7:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 2 new roomies??
(9:52 PM) Robert Seidl: ??? In the same suite ???
(9:55 PM) Robert Seidl: I’m in one of the best classes I’ve been in right now.... the professor is Robert Kallen...
(9:55 PM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(10:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: wowowowowoowowowow
(10:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes same suite

(12:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: sooooo thankful I got to talk to you last night 
(12:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: on another note i’m sorry for talking to lady night in regards to your weekend class 
(12:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: thank you’re going to kill this weekend

(3:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(3:39 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol
(3:41 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya by the way forgot to tell you that while I still enjoyed the second half of the class yesterday, my bullshit radar started firing on the professor with the way he kept bragging about certain things. We shall see if those flags are indeed present lol
(3:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhhhh can’t wait to hear about it on the next episode of “robby + law school”
(3:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if you have any questions about cloud computing kinda fell into a rabbit hole studying for my exam on it 
(3:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so i’m already too deep and have time to figure out what ever questions you have about it if any
(3:57 PM) Robert Seidl: As a matter of fact I do have a couple I’ll run by you later
