(5:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Are you trying to make me think you just might be fucking awesome or something?
(5:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m just trying to explain the sitch and be a decent human 
(5:18 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m beginning to wonder if you might be much more than just a decent human
(5:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m not i swear 
(5:19 AM) Robert Seidl: In that case by that measure, maybe there’s far less decent humans than I thought.
(5:21 AM) Robert Seidl: My guess: The girl is experiencing some unrequited love and / or some girls are just jealous of her so they’re being extremely mean and nasty to her.
(5:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: her dumb bf who just joined a frat and is getting drunk for the first few times in his life
(5:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and kicked her out of the party
(5:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and threw her keys
(5:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: an angry drunk
(5:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i might kill him if I see him
(5:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: fair warning 
(5:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha no violence shefali! 
(5:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Your mission should be to sow the seeds in her mind that she needs to line up a better replacement. 
(5:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that was my first step
(5:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ✔️
(5:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: well that she doesn’t need him
(5:28 AM) Robert Seidl: If she’s crying about it on the street, it means she is too infatuated with him and she probably won’t have the confidence to just move on right away... that is why she’ll have to line someone else up so it doesn’t hurt her as much when she breaks up with him. 

Whereas if it was a girl with your confidence and independence, you could just tell her to dump her like a bad dream and she would. 
(5:30 AM) Robert Seidl: to dump *him*
(5:33 AM) Robert Seidl: You couldd invite her to hang with you tonight  and wing for her.
(5:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: a 3 YEAR RELATIONSHIP 
(5:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: nah my friends just met up with me and left the party
(5:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i don’t know her but from what i’ve gathered they will get back together
(5:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she was on the phone with his mom
(5:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes, they absolutely will get back together. 
(5:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i invited her out but her friend was coming so we all waited with her
(5:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she had so much black eyeliner on 
(5:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha I knew you would invite her 
(5:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh dear on the phone with his mom 😳
(5:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: mom asked to talk to me
(5:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was wild 
(5:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha
(5:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Why do I feel I can picture your behavior so well
(5:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we just walked past a bride who tried to bring us on her bachelorette night 
(5:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and some girls who yelled Nut at a wedding dress
(5:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what thdo damn
(5:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Make it a challenge to get as many bachelorette sashes as you can. My record is 9.
(5:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Wait 7 (that were all from separate parties)
(5:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: damn the most bachelor parties i’ve been a part of in one night is 5 
(5:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m slacking 
(5:42 AM) Robert Seidl: I don’t know what you mean by “been a part of” hahaha I’m just saying the sashes. 
(5:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Crowns count as 2 
(5:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like party busses and stuff 
(5:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: from bars
(5:44 AM) Robert Seidl: Ahh way to be strategic with the logistics 
(5:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i mean what else do you do at a bachelor party besides make friends and get fucked up???
(5:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: then again i’m not a full bro 
(5:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Ohh missed that you said “bachelor” not “bachelorette”
(5:49 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol I just was able to get all of my friends laid (not the groom to be obvi). 
(5:49 AM) Robert Seidl: I was the host of it but I didn’t set up any strippers or anything. We just did a bunch of fun guy stuff all weekend.
(5:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: most of the ones i’ve been too the groom gets laid
(5:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like the first to fuck
(5:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ve never seen strippers 
(5:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i would leave 
(5:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no wait i take it back
(5:51 AM) Robert Seidl: If I ever even was entertaining the idea of strippers being at my bachelor party before I got married... I would immediately know I was not marrying the right person. 
(5:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ve seen strippers once 
(5:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but i thought they were just more ppl
(5:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: then we left 
(5:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i feel like that’s a common necessity to every bachelor party i’ve ever heard of
(5:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya, I mean to each their own... but the whole idea of something so meaningless before something so meaningful (or supposed to be) is extremely repulsive. 
(5:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol I’d rather get my dick cut off than do something like that before my wedding 
(5:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha you crack me up “I’ve seen strippers before”
(5:57 AM) Robert Seidl: ...I guess technically I’ve been a stripper before 😂😂😂
(6:03 AM) Robert Seidl: I totally was going to set up strippers for my friend but he really didn’t want any he wouldn’t have liked it. It wasn’t the fake “I don’t want strippers” (but wink wink get me strippers).. he just wasn’t about that.
(6:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: very dramatic but understandable sir 
(6:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha why is that funny 
(6:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’ve been a stripper but you’ve never stripped for me 
(6:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: seems sketch 
(6:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he seems cool af 
(6:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: good fried

(6:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼why did I walk home in a bunch of frat guys in my kitchen and 
(6:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhhh things you want to do but haven’t
(6:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: do share
(6:37 AM) Robert Seidl: The bad guy vet didn’t want the good guy vet to be able to help take care of more pets in the same town... no need to look at the law the bad guy should be locked and chained immediately..
(6:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: FACTS 
(6:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha 
(6:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I support him being locked away and never being able to play with animals again 
(6:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that sounds like hell on earth

(6:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: get out
(6:43 AM) Robert Seidl: I bet she’d love me 😊
(6:44 AM) Robert Seidl: We’d take walks down the beach listening to N’sync and Backstreet Boys
(6:44 AM) Robert Seidl: (Granted I was always on team Backstreet Boys)
(6:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahha what else do you do in charleston in the morning 
(6:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: TEAM N’SYNC

(6:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is how I feel 😂
(6:50 AM) Robert Seidl: What?!! No that’d be amazing to any girl!!!!! Unless.... you just were too young to understand!!!
(6:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t even get me started with the age comments, grandpa 
(6:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Even if the guy in the picture above stripped for me to Backstreet Boys I’d be forced to give it a thumbs up..
(6:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHHAHAHA 
(6:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I wonder if strippers take request
(6:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like what if you asked one to strip to frank ocean
(6:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: is that a thing
(6:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Of course they would 
(6:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: would it emotionally fuck them up

(6:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: can you strip to edm 
(6:54 AM) Robert Seidl: You do realize whenever I was stripping it was largely in jest and not necessarily trying to be sexy right? 😂
(6:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes I do 
(6:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: leave me alone 
(6:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂😂😂
(6:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m thinking in general 
(6:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼this was full at 9am
(6:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: pm*
(6:56 AM) Robert Seidl: I think the stripping would have a far larger effect sexually if I had already been inside you. 
(6:56 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes yes very standard 
(6:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh okay 
(6:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: cool 
(6:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: makes sense 
(6:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i was speaking hypothetically 
(6:59 AM) Robert Seidl: I could strip to new kids on the block or spice girls if I felt like it 😂😂😂
(6:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼thinkin of you 😉
(7:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK

(7:21 AM) Robert Seidl: Don’t sell yourself short... your much more than just distracting...
(7:22 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re very distracting... 
(7:22 AM) Robert Seidl: In a very good way. 
(7:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sooooo what is the answer....
(7:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: very distracted*
(7:26 AM) Robert Seidl: You know that I always do what I have to do. If I’m allowing myself to be “distracted” by you it’s because I want to and it’s all good 😁
