I don’t plan on eating in a lot but get anything you might want for late night snacks / desserts! 

-If they have it at that Whole Foods there’s a green juiced drink called “greens with envy” (2 little ones) 

-spinach, (for garlic sautéed spinach but I’m pretty sure there’ll be garlic powder and olive oil at the condo from the last time I was there)

-orange juice + a couple of mixers you like for drinks. (Cranberry juice is usually a go to of mine) 

(12:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Please take a pic of the receipt!... or I’ll just round up 
(1:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sooo they don’t have green with envy but
