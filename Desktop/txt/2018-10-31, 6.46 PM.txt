(6:46 PM) Robert Seidl: She might not hold any ill feelings then! (Although she did lie repeatedly in the interview lol, and even though you’re not one of these it’s not uncommon for some girls to operate using subterfuge)

As long as you’re just careful with what she knows about ya etc. 😉
(6:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha you make a valid point about the lies 🤭
(6:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: its highly unlikely that our paths will cross academically from now until january
(6:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: then she’s out of my life forever (hopefully)
(6:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I’d like to think that I am very different from what I used to be like when we were friends, but I have no idea what she knows about me that she would use negatively 😬
(6:52 PM) Robert Seidl: I don’t mean to sound so doom and gloom!!! I just know you’re far more direct [aka honest lol] than most girls are on some things and jealousy / envy is a powerful thing (and for many people it’s literally the strongest driving force in their life). 

Just watching your 6 😉
(6:54 PM) Robert Seidl: (Oh ya and I love watching your 6 for other reasons too if ya know what I mean 😝)
(7:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: what does 6 mean??
(7:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeahhh she gets jealous easily too
(7:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: very insecure individual...
(7:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i kinda want to see her try to ruin me
(7:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😈
(7:07 PM) Robert Seidl: “Watching your 6” means watching your back 
(7:09 PM) Robert Seidl: So when I said “I love watching your 6 for other reasons too” I meant your butt lol 
(7:10 PM) Robert Seidl: I don’t think she’d ever be able to do that, more likely someone like that is only ever able to be a nuisance.
(7:10 PM) Robert Seidl: I love that I can tell you can be extremely tough when you want / need to be. 
(7:11 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahhhh new phrases
(7:11 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: haha cheeky
(7:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you gotta be sometimes
(7:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: my favorite part is that no one seems to expect it
(7:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: everyone I meet at first seems to think I’m this little harmless girl
(7:13 PM) Robert Seidl: I knew you were a dangerous one the moment I met you 
(7:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh boy
(7:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: thats a rare one
(7:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s
