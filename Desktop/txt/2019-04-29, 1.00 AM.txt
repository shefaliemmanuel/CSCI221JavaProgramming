(10:02 PM) Robby Seidl: Like green hair and tight leather pants on a casual night gay 😂
(10:03 PM) Robby Seidl: He’s offering to do glitter makeup / hair for anyone who wants it (he’s a really good hair stylist at Kelly Cardenas)
(10:04 PM) Robby Seidl: Hahaha so if you’re into the glittery festival look... you’ve got a hookup for it 😂

(10:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: as they are in out flat 
(10:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: good i don’t like beards
(10:13 PM) Robby Seidl: I’ll grow a beard sometime when it’s not so “basic male bitch wannabe sauve fuck” to grow one 
(10:14 PM) Robby Seidl: ^and also of course if I was 100% certain it wouldn’t be even the slightest disadvantage professionally..
(10:14 PM) Robby Seidl: Plus they take maintenance 
(10:14 PM) Robby Seidl: I’m too personally utilitarian. Ain’t nobody got time for that 
(10:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s so weird seeing robby in my phone 
(10:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i don’t support this decision to grow a beard 
(10:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i do support glitter robby 
(10:20 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but i’ll have to make it clear that you’re very straight 
(10:26 PM) Robby Seidl: Thumbs down because I clearly said “I do not want to grow and will not be growing a beard” 
(10:27 PM) Robby Seidl: There is no such thing and never will be such thing as glitter Robby 
(10:27 PM) Robby Seidl: As long as a unicorn doesn’t sneeze on me 
(10:28 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: “I’ll grow a beard....”
(10:28 PM) Robby Seidl: That’s a HYPO 
(10:29 PM) Robby Seidl: THETICAL
(10:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: who knows I could be a unicorn for one of the days
(10:30 PM) Robby Seidl: While possible at some point in my life I might briefly have one, I would ALWAYS revert back to my default preference 
(10:31 PM) Robby Seidl: And that mere possibility of the non-default is no where to be seen in the near term or intermediate long term future 
(10:32 PM) Robby Seidl: I think I’d kind of like to see that actually 😂😂😂
(10:32 PM) Robby Seidl: I think you’d be kinda cute probably 😂
(10:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha you can help me pick out my outfits 
(10:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if you would like 
(10:37 PM) Robby Seidl: Always happy to give my opinion upon request 
(10:37 PM) Robby Seidl: But other than that the important thing is you like it 😉
(10:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh yeah see if anything that was delivered recently is of interest

(10:40 PM) Robby Seidl: https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-synagogue-shooting-army-veteran-oscar-stewart-chases-gunman
(10:40 PM) Robby Seidl: It’s guys like these that give me hope that some  men still known how to be men among men
(10:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: WOWOWOWOW
(10:45 PM) Robby Seidl: He basically took a chance where he knew he’d probably die but did it anyway, and the gun jammed.. that’s the only reason he lived. But if he didn’t charge the guy may have had time to un-jam his weapon. 
(10:46 PM) Robby Seidl: This kind of shit should be broadcast in every classroom. These are the type of men that need to be made to be heroes and looked up to. NOT worthless, soul-less celebrities and socialites. 
(10:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: preacccchhhh
(10:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s actually incredible 
(10:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: good for him
(10:52 PM) Robby Seidl: Good for us that we’re still able to have men like him. 
(10:53 PM) Robby Seidl: Glad the re-gressives weren’t able to get this one 😂

(10:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: my door is locked 
(10:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: karissa just left
(10:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: side note about russia trip: all 60 people hated karissa and evan 
(10:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they made the group 30 min late for one of the tours and everyone started clapping and someone yelled “thanks for fucking joining us ugly fuckers”
(10:59 PM) Robby Seidl: Bahahahahaha 😂😂😂😂😂😂

(8:11 AM) Robby Seidl: Would you be jealous that if I got a dog I’d maybe get a girl dog like her? 😂
(8:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha noooooo
(8:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’d love that dog to pieces 
(8:20 AM) Robby Seidl: I know you would 😉
(8:20 AM) Robby Seidl: It’d be one lucky dog.
(8:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: one spoiled doggo 🥰
(8:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: how’s final prep going, champ
(8:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 🤓
(8:24 AM) Robby Seidl: Good. Taking one Tuesday through Friday each day (have to do it by the hours long each one is in their available time slots). Will be done with my last one by 12am Friday.
(8:25 AM) Robby Seidl: A little nervous about the one Wednesday especially as everyone who’s taken it says it’s very hard regardless of how much you study.
(8:27 AM) Robby Seidl: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlAoH8nqIk
(8:27 AM) Robby Seidl: This was in my saved videos from a while ago.. forget to send it to you.. look at the TV screen in the background at minute 1:09 to go.
(8:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: did they give you any insight on what the professor is looking for???
(8:27 AM) Robby Seidl: Sure. 
(8:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: or is it not an essay
(8:27 AM) Robby Seidl: Oh no not the students 
(8:28 AM) Robby Seidl: I know a lot of other students talk about the tests with each other a lot, but I stay away from that as it’s not worth the risk.
(8:29 AM) Robby Seidl: They all have essays and essay parts. 
(8:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahhh yeah i only do it with upperclassmen i’m close with 
(8:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but none of ours are essay styled 
(8:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hummmmm 
(8:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: do you feel prepared??
(8:29 AM) Robby Seidl: People try and busy each other in the law school sometimes though....
(8:29 AM) Robby Seidl: So I stay away from it period. 
(8:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what do you mean 
(8:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like point each other in the wrong direction
(8:30 AM) Robby Seidl: As prepared as I can be.... law school finals can be a crap shoot at WashU
(8:30 AM) Robby Seidl: No.... like turn each other in for cheating 
(8:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh fuck
(8:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what the hell
(8:31 AM) Robby Seidl: It’s strict no talking with each other about the exams once you’ve taken one 
(8:31 AM) Robby Seidl: Ya.
(8:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hard pass in that case
(8:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hey you’re going to do incredible 
(8:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’ve put in the work 
(8:31 AM) Robby Seidl: The Chinese have a massive advantage as they stay tight with each other and all help each other cheat hard fucking core.
(8:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you understand the concepts fully 
(8:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: next language you need to learn?? 
(8:32 AM) Robby Seidl: But they never get caught... they have a Great Wall of loyalty / slight racism against anyone not Chinese  defending them. 
(8:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHAHAHHA
(8:34 AM) Robby Seidl: They kind of brought me in a couple of times 2 years ago but I was worried they could all turn on me and screw me so I stayed away. Didn’t like being vulnerable. 
(8:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so fai 
(8:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: r 
(8:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i would have done the same thing
(8:34 AM) Robby Seidl: Who would they have believed.. me or 7 other students. 
(8:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you never know
(8:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 7 students....
(8:35 AM) Robby Seidl: There’s several Chinese law students yes. 
(8:35 AM) Robby Seidl: And they all take every class together. 
(8:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: how do they never get caught?? answers are diff enough?!
(8:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you know 90% of the law programs here are all tested with oral exams not papers 
(8:37 AM) Robby Seidl: They all speak varying levels of English... so when reading their papers I heard they all still seem different 😂
(8:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: those kids would die
(8:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: A SCAM
(8:41 AM) Robby Seidl: Ya no offense to them  but going to law school in some other countries is really easy / kind of a joke. Most European countries follow a strict civil law legal system which is far more simply codified. Furthermore their judicial processes are far less adversarial in nature as opposed to our highly adversarial common law system. 
(8:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahhhh
(8:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no match 
(8:43 AM) Robby Seidl: They often see our legal system as silly, and overly laborious.... you know because we like to actually do everything we can to give even the most seemingly guilty fair due process and a right to trial by jury..... simply doesn’t work that way in those countries. 
(8:45 AM) Robby Seidl: Very little match. The two systems are very “foreign” to each other. And also many European law schools are far far less strenuous... because their law is all heavily  codified. 
(8:51 AM) Robby Seidl: But then there’s the one outlier state in the US (Louisiana), that adopts many civil law systems similar to the French system (relic from when it was a French colony). The other 49 are common law. Louisiana is the brunt of many a joke to law students. 
(9:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHA I JUST GOT OUT OG THE SHOWER AND STRAIGHT UP SLIPPED SIDEWAYS 
(9:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg that video is me as a child around dogs 
(9:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the husky stuffed animallll
(9:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg all the kisses in the world 
(9:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and peppa is in the background
(8:07 PM) Robby Seidl: Lol ya that video was made for you
