(2:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sounds like a date to me
(4:55 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d be jealous.. 
(4:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Of you getting to have a date with him..
(4:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: do you have more pictures lol
(4:58 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(5:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol btw I love Ernie just as much (he might even be my fav)  but he’s just not very photogenic because you simply can’t ever see his face 
(5:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Winston is just hilarious though 
(5:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha I mean any pictures of your dogs would be great 
(5:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Winston definitely gets far more paparazzi attention  
(5:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Get the video?
(5:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha yes 
(5:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: thank youuu 
(5:04 AM) Robert Seidl: Stubborn little fuck 
(5:05 AM) Robert Seidl: Well not little I guess 
(5:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: one of my roommates applications to get a job just got denied today hahahahaha
(5:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol ya not to be enjoying their misfortune... butttt.... 
(5:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Shocker
(5:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh i’m enjoying it we just got in the stupidest fight 
(5:08 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya really? 
(5:09 AM) Robert Seidl: They weren’t passive aggressive AF?
(5:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was just 1 lol 
(5:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the gay one feels bad and has been trying to do a bunch of nice things for me 
(5:10 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol bet she couldn’t even make eye contact during it
(5:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh she tried real hard 
(5:10 AM) Robert Seidl: Nice! He has some baseline self awareness and a soul! 
(5:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha 
(5:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he just is influenced easily 
(5:13 AM) Robert Seidl: With people like that I sometimes imagine “well I definitely know what you would do if you were German and the nazis were rounding up your neighbors... nothing”
(5:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i think if I said anything like that it was be to much for them 
(5:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Not a very fair example since absolutely no one knows what they would do in situations like that (especially if you had a family to keep safe)
(5:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i think it’s a fair example 
(5:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they would just sit there and their brains would explode for actually thinking before they speak for once
(5:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: brain* 
(5:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I wouldn’t necessarilybe mad 
(5:16 AM) Robert Seidl: But he’s trying. That’s big. Might mean that naturally he has a heart but just wasn’t raised in an environment that gave him the confidence to always follow it.
(5:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah after he came out to his parents and they did nothing but support him hes had self confidence it seems
(5:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Nice! 
(5:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i suppose 
(5:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya people are getting pretty damn chill about that stuff these days for the most part it seems
(5:18 AM) Robert Seidl: To the point where I think most people don’t care at all either way. 
(5:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no one really cares that much if it’s not in their face or bothering them directly 
(5:20 AM) Robert Seidl: (And that’s bad for post-modern leftists because they want identity groups to feel as oppressed as possible) 
(5:21 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m being realllll fucking random 
(5:21 AM) Robert Seidl: This is what days straight of law school reading does to people
(5:21 AM) Robert Seidl: Makes me cookie 
(5:21 AM) Robert Seidl: Dammit spell check 
(5:21 AM) Robert Seidl: *cooky
(5:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha i think you’re hungry 🍪
(5:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Ummm
(5:23 AM) Robert Seidl: You want to know what I got from chick-fil-a?
(5:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: days of straight law school reading sounds like hell 
(5:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what did ya get 
(5:24 AM) Robert Seidl: You have full permission to judge greatly and think I’m an absolute knuckle dragging mongrol 
(5:25 AM) Robert Seidl: 1 southwestern chicken salad, 2 large kale superfoods, 1 spicy chicken sandwich, 1 12 count chicken nugget, and 1 large order of chicken strips. 
(5:26 AM) Robert Seidl: And about 10 chick fil a sauces 
(5:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you like the superfood?????
(5:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: who are you
(5:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Gotta get my greenss
(5:27 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m like Popeye bitch 
(5:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: WHAT the actual fuck HAHAHAHAHAH
(5:27 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂😂the “bitch” wasn’t directed at you I just felt like saying it 😂😂😂😂
(5:28 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m laughing out loud right now 
(5:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: better not have been directed at me 
(5:29 AM) Robert Seidl: I can see your face so clearly right now 
(5:29 AM) Robert Seidl: The expression I see only makes me laugh more 😂😂😂
(5:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god 
(5:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not the effect it’s supusto have hahahah 
(5:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes that’ll always backfire for you 
(5:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also the amount of food you got at chick-fil-a is not surprising or something I would judge you on hahahahaha 
(5:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: have you ever had their Cobb salad 
(5:32 AM) Robert Seidl: What if I told you I no longer had a six pack....
(5:32 AM) Robert Seidl: What would you do if I gained 80 pounds since I last saw you?
(5:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: nothing 
(5:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i don’t have a 6 pack either haha
(5:32 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re a girl!!!!
(5:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Muscle definition is just different...
(5:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Plus.. testosterone..
(5:33 AM) Robert Seidl: And I have lots of that 
(5:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya? Nothing?
(5:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i don’t think i would really care that much 
(5:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’ll have the same personality 
(5:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha I guess my body would then match my eccentricity 
(5:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: stop hahaha
(5:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’re body is perfect either way
(5:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: your 
(5:36 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m raising the BS flag 😝
(5:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you sure about that
(5:37 AM) Robert Seidl: See, i think you actually could find it unattractive if someone let themself go completely... especially if it was out of laziness and not caring, and by not doing it they were no longer being true to themself. 
(5:38 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s what you’d be unattracted to, someone not being true to themself. 
(5:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: in your case I would assume it would be because you’re to busy to work i
(5:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Like if you knew that I loved to workout simply for me and how it made me feel, but then I stopped doing it for no reason (like it wasn’t because I was too busy or something). It would mean I stopped doing something you knew I loved. Which would foster doubt about the strength of my core (non physical core). 
(5:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: out of whatever which is soooooo different 
(5:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I mean I don’t think I would  recognize it as that 
(5:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i would just see it as unhappiness 
(5:43 AM) Robert Seidl: So I do believe you actually that it wouldn’t be SOLELY because of the way someone looked that would make you unattracted.
(5:44 AM) Robert Seidl: I didn’t gain 80 pounds though so don’t worry 
(5:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I agree with that hahaha
(5:44 AM) Robert Seidl: Only 70
(5:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: perfect 
(5:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol 
(5:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: l

(5:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Don’t get fat 
(5:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha 😂😂😂😂
(5:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Jk jk

(5:47 AM) Robert Seidl: I would never

(5:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Especially in the bedroom 
(5:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: only place it’s okay 
(5:48 AM) Robert Seidl: (Currently writing a list of orders to give you)*
(5:49 AM) Robert Seidl: Damn I wish I could say them in German 
(5:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the line 
(5:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: has been crossed 
(5:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ,son

(5:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: send me said list 
(5:50 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m in a very mischievous mood right now, I’d probably be ticking you and chasing you around and stuff right now 
(5:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Tickling***
(5:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha tucking 
(5:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ticking*
(5:51 AM) Robert Seidl: If you were with me right now you would have given me a bunch of stern / death looks...
(5:52 AM) Robert Seidl: All while trying desperately not to smile or laugh so you could be mad 😂😂😂
(5:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i laugh to easily especially around you 
(5:57 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m hopeless with the amount I love being laughing with you and being around you 
(5:58 AM) Robert Seidl: Abs somehow were sore from laughing and my face from smiling more than a few times
(5:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha no wait literally same 😂😂😂 
(6:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i feel like we spend 90% of the time laughing and it’s the best thing ever 
(6:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Yahhh...

(6:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha it’s not even funny ½ the time just stupid or weird lol
(6:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Naturally 
(6:03 AM) Robert Seidl: We’re both weird 
(6:03 AM) Robert Seidl: I think I edge you out on the weirdness though
(6:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: edge me out?
(6:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Win the competition of who’s more weird 
(6:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhhhh I don’t agree with that statement 
(6:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: first of all 
(6:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: have you met me
(6:09 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re so cute when you get a little indignant (lol I can just picture you  and picture you saying this)
(6:10 AM) Robert Seidl: 💁‍♀️ guess we’ll just have to agree to disagree
(6:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha 
(6:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i don’t do that
(6:11 AM) Robert Seidl: Ok ok ok 
(6:11 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m right then 
(6:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no
(6:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: since when
(6:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Wellllll
(6:12 AM) Robert Seidl: There’s a day coming up...
(6:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t answer that smart ass  
(6:12 AM) Robert Seidl: And since that day in 1991
(6:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 5 DAYS AWAY

(6:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: going out a couple night later 
(6:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Nahh
(6:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no?
(6:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Nope
(6:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: why 
(6:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Probably not. It’s finals!! 
(6:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i think i’m more excited for your birthday than you are 
(6:16 AM) Robert Seidl: I guarantee that 
(6:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh ahahha 
(6:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what time is your final on your birthday 
(6:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Early afternoon I think 
(6:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so you get to sleep in!!
(6:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: a present 🎁 
(6:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha 
(6:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Girl you trippin’?
(6:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sir no sir 
(6:18 AM) Robert Seidl: 🤦‍♂️
(6:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHHAHA
(4:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼1 Exam down!! 😂

(9:02 PM) Robert Seidl: Nice! 
(9:02 PM) Robert Seidl: I know you didn’t leave any questions blank 
(9:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: how are yours going???
(9:53 PM) Robert Seidl: Good! Got two take homes out of the way early. Lol had to force myself to turn them in after several proofreads otherwise I’ll just endlessly edit right up until the deadline. 
(9:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: there you go!! 
(10:49 PM) Robert Seidl: Also, I can’t explain this fully but it seems that even when I’m lost in thought focusing on something I’m still somehow thinking about you in my subconscious. It doesn’t take away from my focus, quite the contrary... if anything my focus is slightly enhanced. 

And on another side note, I swear there are times where I catch myself thinking of you, and I get this sense that you are also thinking of me right at that exact moment. As if when one of us starts thinking about the other it triggers the other person to join and vice versa. 
(1:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha so weird you mention that I just got out of my final and my hand started hurting in the middle of the exam so I look took a break from writing and totally started day dreaming about you for like a solid 5 minutes and Professor Hajja staring at me is the only thing that snapped me out of it 😂
(1:22 AM) Robert Seidl: 😳 That doesn’t sound like I was helping!!!
(1:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha maybe I should’ve kept myself from thinking about you today if it is contagious 😜
(1:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’re good I finished with an hour 45 to spare 
(1:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha 
(1:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Haha wow 
(1:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Impressive 
(1:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(1:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not impressive I just know when to quit if i’m uncertain about something rather then just messing with it and redoing the problem hahaha 
(1:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: multiple times 
(1:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha sounds eerily similar.... but with math 
(1:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: one of my prof was like oh it’s only 4 problems 
(1:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: however he failed to inform us each question had 15 parts.....
(1:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol that’s a pet peeve of mine. Just be straight up and be like there’s 60 parts 
(1:39 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s always the math oriented professors that do that 
(1:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Finance, economics, accounting etc.
(1:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I was helping some friends with business stats 
(1:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 1 problem is like a page wrong
(1:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: long 
(1:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wild af 
(1:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I kinda expected something like that because ghosh enjoys mind fucking us 
(1:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he gets an evil smile and everything 
(1:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and all of my test tend to be 15-20 pages so I figured 4 questions was to good to be true
(1:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Accounting and finance each problem was usually 3-4 pages. And if you fucked up one of the first steps then everything was going to be wrong. 
(1:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Guess what I usually did in the first steps especially if it was a timed test lol? 
(1:44 AM) Robert Seidl: It was but for the grace if god that the accounting professor would only mark off a couple of points as long as your process was right for the rest of the problem.
(1:45 AM) Robert Seidl: Why could I almost see you occasionally being the professor with the evil smile? 
(1:45 AM) Robert Seidl: (If you were teaching an advanced class where the students were cocky)
(1:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: when ever I have tutored managerial accounting students here their problems have been surprisingly short 
(1:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but also that might just be CofC.....
(1:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah the prob in the school of business don’t give partial credit 
(1:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like none of them
(1:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I am a hardass when you’re first in my class 
(1:48 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya I could totally see that with you 
(1:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but honestly if those cocky students were in my class I would totally give them a different test and say i’m just making A B ones to fuck them over 
(1:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I hate those kids 
(1:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I was studying with one of them today and one of the other guys in my group was like “you’re actually so wrong please go fuck someone else’s grade over I can’t afford it”
(1:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol 
(1:56 AM) Robert Seidl: I can see the reality show for comp sci students 
(1:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s called silicon valley on HBO 😉🤓
(1:59 AM) Robert Seidl: I think you could solve half of their tension and anxiety just by getting them laid and on a consistent fitness routine 
(2:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: getting them laid would just confuse them 
(2:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they break when they have sex 
(2:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh shit you’re right they’d fall in love 
(2:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Right away 
(2:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and not do any work 
(2:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and then get even more stressed 
(2:01 AM) Robert Seidl: And the girl would stop talking to them 
(2:01 AM) Robert Seidl: And the spiral would wind down ever more 
(2:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ve seen this happen toooooo many times 
(2:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Ok ok.... teach them how to get and keep a consistent girlfriend (instead of just getting them laid)  
(2:02 AM) Robert Seidl: But then still, I bet their productivity would still go down
(2:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if you show any interest in their personal like rather then academic they think you’re in love with them 
(2:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so i’m not helping 😂😂😂
(2:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: than*
(2:05 AM) Robert Seidl: The dream they all have of writing the new program or coming up with the new thing that’s going to get them rich / famous... so THEN they can get the girl and lord over the world and all who ever wronged / doubted them... is 99% of what keeps those young zucks going with so much motivation...
(2:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Therefore for the good of society we should keep the young zucks romantically confused and sexually frustrated.
(2:08 AM) Robert Seidl: Allow them to keep chasing their tale into their late 40’s / 50’s until a girl past her prime settles with them and they feel they’ve hit the jack-pot. 
(2:08 AM) Robert Seidl: This is dark 😂😂😂😂
(2:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Makes me sad I just want to help them realize they don’t have to become a tech dark lord to win at life 😂
(2:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I mean if they are happy do they actually know the difference????
(2:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if you can get what you can get- do you really have grounds to be upset about it
(2:11 AM) Robert Seidl: So funny but when you really think about it the vast majority of productivity that has ever come about in all of human history  would not have occurred but for sex 😂😂😂😂😂😂
(2:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Black Hats are the sexiest type of tech
(2:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what do you mean??? 😂😂😂😂
(2:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I mean youre not wrong hahaha
