(3:24 PM) Robert Seidl: And they didnâ€™t need to get the green one to take substantial control of Europe.. they did it  through fiat and the European Union lol 
(3:28 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I canâ€™t do research with Prof Dumas :( 
(3:29 PM) Robert Seidl: Awee Iâ€™m sorry sweetie, why not?
(3:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: March- May is when all of the Masters students defend their thesis 

and heâ€™s super overwhelmed (which I kinda noticed in class) 

and Iâ€™m pretty sure he only accepts students that have taken the course that iâ€™m in right now 
(3:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: which totally makes sense, but I thought since Dr. Starr had recommended I do research with him their might have been a possibility 
(3:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also heâ€™s one of the directors for the masters program and they are revising the ITM program and launching it this fall 
(3:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but he was super sweet about it 
(3:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: iâ€™ve just never been turned down for research, but itâ€™s okay! 
(3:35 PM) Robert Seidl: Well you werenâ€™t turned down! It sounds like itâ€™s only because of the timing! You never know what you could do for / with him in the future! Or he could end up recommending you to work with someone good! 
(3:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Thatâ€™s tough though sweetheart I understand. I wish I could give you a big hug (and probably a kid or two.. or 70)
(3:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Kiss*****
(3:38 PM) Robert Seidl: GOD DAMN SPELL CHECK Hahahaha 
(3:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
(3:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: (part of me is kinda glad because heâ€™s the type of guy who teaches one thing and then when you ask him about it says another thing and then marks your paper wrong until you remind him of what he said...)
(3:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I hate working with those kind of people but Dr. Starr can be the same 
(3:40 PM) Robert Seidl: Hmmm ya not fun to deal with that inconsistency 
(3:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: like I went in to review one of my projects for his class today and he totally started contradicting what he told us in class and then I proved it to him and he was like oh youâ€™re right
(3:40 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol 
(3:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also stressed about grad school because this was supusto be a major advantage for me 
(3:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: iâ€™ll figure something else out tho 
(3:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: no worries
(3:42 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes you will.
(3:42 PM) Robert Seidl: Iâ€™m so proud of you and how hard youâ€™re working.
(3:43 PM) Robert Seidl: Youâ€™re going to turn this experience into something great.
(3:45 PM) Robert Seidl: I seriously couldnâ€™t be more proud. Youâ€™re an amazing wonderful intelligent determined beautiful girl. 
(3:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also canâ€™t see my self moving to eastern europe besides pursuing school 
(3:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ï¿¼I am no longer a cougar ðŸ˜‚

(10:14 PM) Robert Seidl: Were you planning on going out before or after that? What time were you planning on? Iâ€™d like to not alter your plans 
(10:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: no itâ€™s perfect I wasnâ€™t planning on going out tonight and thatâ€™s when they would all be leaving to go to bars
(10:16 PM) Robert Seidl: You promise you already werenâ€™t planning on going out?
(10:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I swear- I donâ€™t really want to go out since all my girlfriends are gone and this is still a foreign country

(10:20 PM) Robert Seidl: My family and I were going to do something at 6, so I wouldnâ€™t be able to skype too long.. Iâ€™m good for 5 but if you thought sometime tomorrow would be better we could always do that too.
(10:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: nooo we can facetime some other time 
(10:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: donâ€™t worry about it
