(11:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: awhhhh poor winston 
(12:18 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s a sad day
(12:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol apparently he was getting really obnoxious the past couple of days.
(12:21 AM) Robert Seidl: Running through the electrical fence and not caring, torturing Ernie (for Ernie this week has been like being trapped in prison with a giant gay monster), laying on people and refusing to move, and walking around whining out of sexual frustration.
(12:21 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahah
(12:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: maybe he knew this day would come 
(12:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha oh my god
(12:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sounds like winston could give less of a fuck 
(12:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ve never related more 
(1:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha 
(1:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Love it 
(1:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya no he doesn’t he’s just raging hormones... we’ll maybe not anymore..... he’s going to wake up and be like What. The. Fuck.
(1:06 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s absolutely terrifying.... I can not imagine...
(1:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wait what’s terrifying
(1:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I recently encountered a pig that had that same procedure and he was just feisty, upset, and sad all at the same time
(1:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and humping everything
(1:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Waking up and not having balls is terrifying 
(1:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: basically PMSing ahah
(1:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: can’t relate
(1:13 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya that’s exactly what they said Winston became like this week all of a sudden hahaha 
(1:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Best way to help you relate is imagine waking up and you don’t have 2 of your limbs 
(1:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: traumatic
(1:14 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s that level..
(1:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol he probably won’t know anything’s different... but he’ll sure feel different 😂😂😂
(1:15 AM) Robert Seidl: If I didn’t have balls you would probably be extremely unattracted to my personality 
(1:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 🥶
(1:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if that happened to me I would prob just try to sleep the feeling away
(1:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh?? do expand
(1:24 AM) Robert Seidl: It’d change the heck out of my hormones... basically it’d be a total pussy version of me, I would no longer be constantly sexualized, and it’d feel more like I was one of your girlfriends 😂
(1:28 AM) Robert Seidl: I would not want you to be a guy
(1:29 AM) Robert Seidl: That would make me very sad lol 
(1:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahahahaha but what if the roles were reversed
(1:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’re already a best friend…… girlfriend isn’t too far from that 😉
(1:33 AM) Robert Seidl: That sounds like a nightmare too 😂😂
(1:34 AM) Robert Seidl: (The roles being reversed)
(1:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh jeezzzz
(1:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Stop it 
(1:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t know what you’re talking about Id be a great guy/ boyfriend
(1:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I’ve even been refereed to as “the man“ 🤩
(1:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also apple released a new emoji to fit 🥺
(1:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Please no 
(1:54 AM) Robert Seidl: We’ve wound our way down a dark path 
(1:56 AM) Robert Seidl: A question mark in a box? That’s a dumb emoji 
(1:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Apple is dumb 
(1:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is what happens when you don’t update your phone……
(1:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t blame your poor habits on Apple
(1:59 AM) Robert Seidl: Hmmm
(1:59 AM) Robert Seidl: I thought you would’ve been more freaked out about the “Apple is dumb” comment
(1:59 AM) Robert Seidl: It was meant as a troll to elicit a priceless expression on your face 
(2:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(2:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol honestly I haven’t liked any new products Apple has released in years
(2:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: maybe its because I’m converting from a die hard fan to a neutral ahahahah
(2:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you might have gotten the expression out of me if it was said in person
(2:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya it would’ve been in an extremely offensive, dry, and biting tone 
(2:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the inflection would be the only reason I would have reacted
