(6:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the rest not so much
(6:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: can you strip to edm 
(6:54 AM) Robert Seidl: You do realize whenever I was stripping it was largely in jest and not necessarily trying to be sexy right? 😂
(6:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes I do 
(6:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: leave me alone 
(6:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂😂😂
(6:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m thinking in general 
(6:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼this was full at 9am
(6:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: pm*
(6:56 AM) Robert Seidl: I think the stripping would have a far larger effect sexually if I had already been inside you. 
(6:56 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes yes very standard 
(6:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh okay 
(6:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: cool 
(6:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: makes sense 
(6:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i was speaking hypothetically

(7:22 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re very distracting... 
(7:22 AM) Robert Seidl: In a very good way. 
(7:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sooooo what is the answer....
(7:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: very distracted*
(7:26 AM) Robert Seidl: You know that I always do what I have to do. If I’m allowing myself to be “distracted” by you it’s because I want to and it’s all good 😁

(6:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’re the one who said you would love hearing about it tho 
(6:46 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes I would. And not because I have an affinity for numbers and matrices 
(6:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I was told that matrix’s should make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside so i’m just tryna share the feeling

(12:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Because lately googles been filtering all kinds of things in its algorithms... and I like to stay unfiltered 😂
(12:27 AM) Robert Seidl: I think the hurricanes are a sign that you should temporarily re-locate to the Midwest, particularly the St. Louis area, until hurricane season is over sometime in December. You know. Just to be safe....
(12:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahahhahaha 
(12:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Hi, my name's Microsoft. Can I crash at your place tonight?

(12:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Um. Ya. Mac-girl who?
(12:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omggggg
(12:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: You still use Internet Explorer? You must like it nice and slow.
(12:32 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ll def trade make that trad for the more interesting, dynamic, adventurous, and strong Microsoft that crashes occasionally because the highs are fucking high... over my basic bitch what everybody else does because it’s “safe” and easier Mac..... 😂😂😂😂
(12:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Why not have Internet Explorer, safari, and google chrome altogether???? That why you can sometimes go slow, sometimes be adventurous (you know, like safari adventurous 😂), and sometimes have it hard and intense  as fuck (no idea if that applies to google chrome but it was worth a shot) 
(12:35 AM) Robert Seidl: That way* not “that why”
(12:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m sitting on my yoga mat just actually burst out laughing 
(12:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the entire studio is silent
(12:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: first of all Mac are not basic 
(12:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: basic people just enjoy the aesthetic
(12:39 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂😂
(12:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Are your pants a compressed file? Because I'd love to unzip them!
(12:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ll be back in an hour lol
(12:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Easy, easy, killa..... ^^^for the purposes of you being the Microsoft only! 
(12:41 AM) Robert Seidl: I just had an image of you unzipping my pants (with your teeth)
(2:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the one time id be okay being Microsoft 
(2:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: intense as fuck = google chrome 
(2:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: facts
(2:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that image can be a reality 
(3:28 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d return the favor and pull your panties to the side with my teeth....
(3:29 AM) Robert Seidl: Or just rip them off..

(4:28 AM) Robert Seidl: ...he’s still a puppy... not even a year old.... 
(4:29 AM) Robert Seidl: I had to feed him 3 times today and he still acted like he’s starving
(6:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: how big is he going to get???

(6:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Whoooo knowsss at this point lol
(6:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes yes, it’s a challenge 😂
(6:16 AM) Robert Seidl: We’re literally dieting him so he doesn’t outgrow his joints too fast and have problems. He could easily eat several pounds a day if we let him.
(6:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: noooooo 
(6:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: poor baby 
(6:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha no he’s fine! It’s normal to have to do with his breed

(6:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she seems cute
(6:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol he was pissed at me for a few minutes because I told him he better be strapping it 😂😂😂
(6:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha I know he’s not dumb but teens can be very dumb 
(6:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh wait.....

(6:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh yeah those teens 
(6:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that was ages ago 
(6:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I can barely remember what it felt like to be so young 
(6:29 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂😂😂
(6:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Idk how somehow you made me ok with that because I don’t think I would’ve normally been ok with it at all.... I’m just going to continue to pretend you’re 7 years older than them because that’s what it seems like anyways 😂😂😂
(6:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you def sound like the cool older brother “better be strapping it you teen” 😂😂😂
(6:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha I wasn’t in their shoes 3 years ago at all 
(6:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Soooo weirddddd
(6:35 AM) Robert Seidl: And yet I still like you when you make me realize things like that.....
(6:36 AM) Robert Seidl: It really is because you’re light years ahead of most females my age
(6:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: is this your way of telling me you’re into older females 
(6:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what a coug 
(6:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya... you’re the cougar....
