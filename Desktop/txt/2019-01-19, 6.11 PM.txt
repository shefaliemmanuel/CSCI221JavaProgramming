(1:01 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m down 
(1:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also my studio started a power 1 class that is not at active, so you work through each pose and can adjust rather than just getting it done, it was KILLER maybe something you should think of trying (each pose 10-15 seconds longer(

(6:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Ashton wants to do NYC or Vegas
(7:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Would absolutely do NYC with Ashton
(4:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: woke up to a dream about you this morning:

there were a series of room we walked through almost like one big hallway with different experiences 

started off with my going to my junior year prom, then straight through to a Rave I went to freshman yeah of high school, then to the student housing in Estonia 

through the entire dream you were like leading the way and holding my left hand as I said Hi to my friends in each room
(5:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: by the time we got to one of the 2 beds I we just got under the sheets and I like wrapped my legs around your waist and put my head on your chest 
(5:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and sighed and then I woke up
(5:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wash weird
(5:08 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha very interesting!!
(5:09 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s quite a dream! 
(5:11 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m honored to have been that prevalent in it, and boy do I wish I could’ve been simultaneously dreaming it with you. 
(5:12 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re right handed right?
(5:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that would have been something else 
(5:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yep right handed 
(5:19 AM) Robert Seidl: I actually think the tech could be possible someday..
(5:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Yo know.... coming from a tech expert 😝
(5:20 AM) Robert Seidl: You*
(5:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha yeah probably if you wore a helmet while you slept 
(5:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: did you hear about netflix party
(5:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Nope. What is it?
(5:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so joe was telling me when you open it in chrome and log in with your Netflix it can sync up our accounts so we can watch the same movie at the same time and like if one person pauses it then it will pause for both sides  
(5:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and FaceTime each other  simultaneously 
(5:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha really?
(5:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: apparently!
(5:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also heard graze let’s you do it
(5:28 AM) Robert Seidl: I kind of like it and we just might have to have movie night sometime 
(5:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: GAZE*
(5:29 AM) Robert Seidl: Can’t say I watch Netflix too much by my lonesome but if it’s a date then I’m in 😉
(5:30 AM) Robert Seidl: I kind of have a place in my heart for our old school way of counting down on a video to time it perfectly 😂
(5:34 AM) Robert Seidl: A date with you 
(5:34 AM) Robert Seidl: You being the very very key element 
(5:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: haha let’s do it 
(5:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I have never enjoyed count downs, but they have become my preference with you 
(5:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(5:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: starting them off young 
(6:22 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha is she using Java?
(6:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: nah C+ she’s a natural pro
(6:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: did you see the moon?
(6:37 AM) Robert Seidl: Nope 
(6:37 AM) Robert Seidl: I can’t do that
(6:39 AM) Robert Seidl: ...because then I’ll get really hairy (like hairier than normal) and want to bite people really really bad
(6:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I was always team Jacob...
(6:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: even had a poster of him in my room 😂
(6:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Huh?
(6:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Ohhh
(6:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Twighlight..
(6:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: twilight? 
(6:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha
(6:41 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha wasn’t paying attention 
(6:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is the only night there will be a red moon for the next 80 years 
(6:42 AM) Robert Seidl: Ughhh are you saying I need to go take a look..
(6:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼nah here’s a picture my dad just took 
(6:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t get the hype
(6:43 AM) Robert Seidl: I don’t either. It’s a phenomenon we understand.. 
(6:44 AM) Robert Seidl: Now if we didn’t have modern science.... then seeing shit like that would be hella trippy 
(6:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: maybe it’s something spiritual 
(6:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: science 
(6:45 AM) Robert Seidl: I have a feeling it’s always astrology types that love things like lunar eclipses the most 
(6:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Now space travel where we’re using science to accomplish miraculous feats.... that shit is bad ass
(6:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: totalllyyyy different 
(6:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: astrology intertwined into lots of religions 
(6:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: is^
(6:48 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(6:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: seems legit
(6:49 AM) Robert Seidl: Now that was cool
(6:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Sure the “priests” of all religions were just the people who understood and kept secret bits and pieces of science and things they knew about the world and celestial patterns. So when they’d make predictions about things that would happen people would go “wowww how’d youu kno dat?!!!” 
(6:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(6:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow every 5 min everyone is like let’s check the moon SOS 
(6:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Haha I mean it’s cool 
(6:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m not here for it I don’t have a jacket 😂
(6:52 AM) Robert Seidl: But I also don’t understand the level of  hype 
(6:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I’m safe I think it’s over now 
(6:54 AM) Robert Seidl: The lunar eclipse was cool because it was so eerie. 
(6:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼U
(6:56 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol you saying I have a big butt?
(6:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: maybeeeee
(6:57 AM) Robert Seidl: I don’t get the Michael Scott significance..
(6:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I’m not a huge fan of the office 
(6:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so I couldn’t tell ya
(6:58 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m pretty fond of it. Dwight is the reason
(6:59 AM) Robert Seidl: Knew someone who was exactly like him and unintentionally funny as hell 
(7:00 AM) Robert Seidl: My boyfriend is going to another super bowl 
(7:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Tim??
(7:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ah I see how that could enhance the show
(7:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Tom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(7:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh hahhaha
(7:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: typo??
(7:01 AM) Robert Seidl: No it wasn’t 
(7:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: .....
(7:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Your face gave away your lie.... 
(7:01 AM) Robert Seidl: ...even through text
(7:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: whatttttt
(7:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya
(7:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: are you talkinggggg about
(7:02 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s how OBVIOUS it was 
(7:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I know i’m bad at lying, but damn 
(7:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Well, you’ll probably become a Tom Brady fan after I persuade you. 
(7:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t know about all that 
(7:04 AM) Robert Seidl: He’s the epitome of the underdog story against all odds and pure perseverance through hard work, determination, and self belief no matter what.
(7:06 AM) Robert Seidl: When I tell it to you while showing you a few videos (don’t worry I’ll keep it under 20 minutes bahaha), you’ll be a fan because you understand and respect that kind of perseverance and hard work 
(7:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh wow can’t wait 
(7:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I might become a fan of him only for those concepts tho 
(7:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t really invest in football players pasts
(7:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: experiences 
(7:08 AM) Robert Seidl: The haters of Tom Brady.... are the people that hate to be confronted with what they could have accomplished in their own life but never could, because they never even tried, because they were too afraid of failing. All of his haters are actually just envious as fuck at his grit and success against all odds, and therefore have always tried to dismiss his accomplishments. 
(7:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: are you sure people think this deeply about football??
(7:10 AM) Robert Seidl: I never said they fully conceptualize this in their frontal cortex....
(7:10 AM) Robert Seidl: They just think they “hate” Tom Brady 
(7:11 AM) Robert Seidl: But yes.... football and sports can be that deep... and much deeper. 
(7:12 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s a mirror of wills being forced and imposed against each other. A battle of heart. 
(7:13 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s when sports can be fun and entrancing as hell...
(7:14 AM) Robert Seidl: I get into sports when there are deep and compelling tales of tremendous heart being created...
(7:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Tom Brady is such a tale...
(7:15 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re right though most people don’t think that deeply about it.... but you better believe the greats such as Tom do. 
(7:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Anyone who is ever great in anything looks at all of life like that. 
(7:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Tom Brady is NOT the most physically talented player.... not even close. 
(7:20 AM) Robert Seidl: He just had more heart than anyone who goes up against him. That’s why he can’t be beaten. Not in the long term. Even when he has a tough time or gets beaten momentarily.... he comes back better, stronger, hungrier, and eventually wins by pure force of will. 
(7:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: awh is that what people love him
(7:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: his heart? 
(7:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: makes sense why anyone loves any figure 
(7:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Ehhh probably not the way most people look at it but some probably do. Everyone can recognize  greatness like his eventually. Over time greatness like that becomes obvious to all and impossible to ignore. 
(7:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I’m driving with Do Not Disturb While Driving turned on. I’ll see your message when I get where I’m going.

(7:56 AM) Robert Seidl: Child 
(7:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Whether*
(7:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: whore child.

(8:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahah I feel quite the opposite
