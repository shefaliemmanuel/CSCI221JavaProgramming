(3:41 AM) Robert Seidl: Why did you workout?
(4:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I didn’t that’s just what it feels like 
(4:13 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ve never done a stair master focused workout lol so I guess I can’t picture where that soreness would be exactly...
(4:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 10000 squats
(4:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol gotcha. This soreness wasn’t my fault in some way was it?
(4:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: noooo nothing bad 😂 just sore hips 
(4:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼

(6:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Hey Greg (the uber driver) called me back! He said he has the jacket and would be able to drop it off either tonight or whenever works. Would you be free to receive it at your place by any chance?
(7:16 AM) Robert Seidl: (If not, tomorrow or another day is totally fine - or I can have kyle grab it if you’re really busy the next couple days!)
(12:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg amazing 
(12:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ll be at my place today from like 5pm onwards
