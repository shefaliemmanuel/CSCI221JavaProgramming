(4:50 PM) Robert Seidl: ￼
Lol no idea why the phone is shaking like it is on the video (it wasn’t while I was recording), but this is how I woke up 
(4:52 PM) Robert Seidl: Anytime is fine on the flight! 
(4:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if it keeps happening the back camera has been 

A. liquid damaged 
B. lose connection 
C. physical damage (ex: cracked) 
D. thermal damage (ex: keeping your phone in the car when it’s really hot outside)

maybe just needs to be replaced 

around $60 if I remember correctly
(4:57 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh 
(4:58 PM) Robert Seidl: Shnighckies
(4:58 PM) Robert Seidl: It’s probably from my run where was hot AF 
(4:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: was it in directly sunlight 
(4:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and is it consistently every time you take a video
(4:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: or photo
(4:59 PM) Robert Seidl: I think but I thought it had experienced that a lot
(4:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it can only take so much
(5:00 PM) Robert Seidl: That was the first time I noticed something like that 
(5:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: from camera as well?
(5:03 PM) Robert Seidl: Never noticed it on the front camera
(5:09 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hummmm
(5:10 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: consistently with the back camera?
(5:12 PM) Robert Seidl: I just tested it by taking another video and it wasn’t doing it lol
(5:12 PM) Robert Seidl: ...
(5:12 PM) Robert Seidl: Maybe it was the power of Gracie 
(5:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lmao no that means there is a loose connection 
(5:13 PM) Robert Seidl: The camera couldn’t handle the cuteness 
(5:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so it will be random and typically get worse over time 
(5:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but I like your idea better
