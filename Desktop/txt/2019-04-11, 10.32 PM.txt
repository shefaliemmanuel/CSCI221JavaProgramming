(10:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHA *walk into the apartment* “I think our kids would be best friends; they would compliment each other like we do”- Sophia 
(1:54 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂
(1:56 AM) Robert Seidl: You were probably like sure... I’m cool with my kids being your kids ‘imaginary friends’ 
(1:58 AM) Robert Seidl: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IUXteUGhh7w
(1:58 AM) Robert Seidl: Couple anecdotal examples of cultural relativist virtue signaling gone horribly wrong like I mentioned the other day..
(2:00 AM) Robert Seidl: This would be Sophia and nanekae if they traveled through North Africa / the Middle East....
(2:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Or this would be an idea Sophia’s kids would come up with 😂😂😂. Aren’t you excited for your future kids to be friends with them and compliment how empathetic and caring each other are on their trip!!! 
(2:02 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂
(4:00 AM) Robert Seidl: So how DID this phenomena of millennial progressives traveling to middle eastern countries to showcase the loving world (as they know it) but then having tragically ironic fates come to be — It all started on a university campus near you: 

Have you ever seen how  unafraid of danger all of the rabbits and squirrels are on a college campus? A few years of breeding in a bubble wrap environment where most predators and threats have been eliminated.... leads to generations of squirrels and bunnies, that have zero concept of how dangerous the wild can be. What would’ve been threats in the wild, the furry critters simply see as another potential snack source. Most of the time, the worst the sorority focused 22 year old girl the bunny hopped up to is going to do to it, is smear Maybelline makeup all over the bunny’s fur... because.. CUDDLES. 

BUT, what if Maybelline KD girl also happens to be a campus activist for progressive groups, and one of them is even animal rights, and like the bunny she ALSO has no concept of the harsh realities of nature (you see, Maybelline girl has been brought up in a bubble wrapped society of her own). So out of the goodness of her heart Maybelline Mandy rounds up as many of the trusting furry critters as she can, and begins to Uber to the edge of town. Unfortunately for the critters, Maybelline Mandy hasn’t been out of the city much, or even come close to stepping Louboutin heel on an Iowa farm — where things are born, die, and are eaten on a daily basis. Therefore, sweet Mandy’s perception of nature is somewhat of a cross between Snow White and Alice in Wonderland. 

So Mandy, while driving to the woods out of town with her soon to be freed into the loving world furry friends, of course has been documenting the entire adventure on Instagram live and Snapchat. All of her Maybelline sisters like her story in approval while awe-ing at Mandy’s cute new friends. All the more inspired by her friends likes, Mandy excitedly pulls up to an open field and lets the squirrels and rabbits loose. 

At a tree line by the edge of the field, a couple hunters step forward. Several of the critters eagerly make their way towards the hunters. YAY!! Another food source! (Mandy meanwhile, has never seen a hunter, and thinks the men are traffic cops due to their orange vests). Mandy live streams as the hunters happily fill most of the rabbits and a few of the squirrels with lead... (all of whom up until their last moment were excited for their snack from a new friend). Tears of horror streak down Mandy’s Maybelline laden face... not because of the critters (she just thinks they’re sleeping)... the tears fall due to all of the insensitive comments she’s getting. “Why doesn’t everyone love me like usual?!!!”

Devastated, Mandy gets back in her Uber and heads back to campus. The uber driver, Ted, hands Mandy a trash bag saying, “if you’re going to do it, get it IN the bag.” Little does Ted know, Mandy’s not drunk and tripping on Molly... she’s just progressive. The whole ride back, all Mandy can think about is what next virtue signaling adventure she will choose to make up for all of the negative comments she just received.

The next day, Mandy explains to her professor before class the prior day’s events. The Professor wants to fuck Mandy so he skirts over the little detail that the animals actually died and tells her she did a great thing... because he reasons, she helped solve the problem of overpopulation.   Mandy doesn’t know what overpopulation means, but thinks that since her professor is in a position of authority.. that he is like, super smart. Plus she likes his soothing voice. He’s just so nice 🤗 . She nods.   The professor asks if most of the bunnies that went to sleep were white. Mandy nods. The professor replies, “even better!” “Don’t worry Mandy, have a seat.” 

Professor Arnis then proceeds to give his multiculturalism class lecture of the day on “The Inherent Racism White People Have Towards North African and Middle Eastern Countries By Not Wanting To Visit Them”.. How dare any implicit bias filled bigots think it is dangerous to go to the Middle East, when all of the people there are actually magically wonderful peace lovers whom Americans should prove their love to. That’s when Mandy gets a wonderful idea💡!!! 

That night, Mandy packs 15 pairs of shoes and enough Maybelline to last an entire strip club a week (amongst other things)... and she posts a Snap of her just purchased plane ticket to Syria with the caption, “I’m going to be just like the furry critters I saved yesterday! I’m going to show my love and understanding to the people of Isis, and that they deserve my love and acceptance by going to sleep with them.”
