(12:21 AM) Robert Seidl: I 100% understand that sentiment (and share it and very much want you to lol)

Though difficult as it may be sometimes... it’s usually best to err on the side of not taking a chance at creating an unnecessary future enemy. Sometimes you never know where or in what position someone will be just by dumb luck in-spite of their incompetence. Plus.. you already won 😉. 

IN FACT you could take an slightly creative path: perhaps instead of a passive aggressive I told you so (though satisfying as it might be)... you can make some lemonade. Maybe you could send him an email actually thanking him for his help and guidance, and thanking him for stressing how important it would be to work extra hard in the class, and credit him with your success in achieving the highest grade, and make it genuine. It’s a rare breed that is able to create allies in all of the places where anyone else would have only naturally and rightfully created enemies. 
(12:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha that’s what i did
(12:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: my mom told me to wait a couple days to send it 
(12:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just basically thanking him for approving the course so I could have this opportunity 
(12:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I hope you didn’t think I would ACTUALLY send an email like that to anyone 
(12:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also listening to the chubby video
(12:26 AM) Robert Seidl: And that is why you’re CEO material
(12:27 AM) Robert Seidl: I stopped probably around minute 20 or so 
(12:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m at 23
(12:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Also you would’ve been well within your rights, and as long as you’re at least fairly certain they’ll never have that capacity to get back at you... sometimessss in that case a little ‘I told you so’ can be 100% healthy and even help motivate you.

(12:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no i’m not an “I told you so” kinda girl 
(12:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s just stupid and juvenile 
(12:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol 
(12:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: as if someone will actually respect what you’re saying then
(12:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I was just talking when I was telling you
(12:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s nothing I would act on 
(12:31 AM) Robert Seidl: I was thinking of something more along the lines of, “you say I can’t do this, watch me go it.” 
(12:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: besides it not even worth it
(12:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: doesn’t effect me 
(12:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh well that, yeah
(12:32 AM) Robert Seidl: Yup when there’s nothing to gain, there’s usually something to lose. 
(6:32 AM) Robert Seidl: I hope I don’t freak you out (too much) with all my serious talk about how much I love you and how deep in I am. I really don’t think I could hide it if I tried. You’re becoming everything to me. Not that I don’t have plenty of other purpose and missions 😜... but inevitably you seem to be becoming more intwined with me and with my whole heart and soul. To the point that I must admit.. it becomes an additional  purpose of mine to be the best partner in crime I can possibly be for you. Your wants,  desires, and purpose all  become part of my own purpose and mission.   Just name it Shefali, you want the moon? I’ll lasso it down for you (quote from “It’s A Wonderful Life”). 

All this of course to say that I’d 1000% understand if I’m a little much 😉.... after all I would be to most (even without all the sapp like this 😂). I’m already at a  point where I’m immensely grateful simply for having had the pleasure of knowing you and being with you. It’s been sooo worth it, even if you said by Felicia tomorrow. 

I strongly encourage you not to do the Felicia thing though, and to instead love on me to your hearts desire 😜. I can’t say I could think of something that would make me a happier man... that is as long as it is part of what makes you the happiest woman.
(2:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you didn’t freak me out at alllll 😋 I feel the same way about a lot of things you said, but specifically about how “you seem to be becoming more intwined with me and with my whole heart and soul”
(2:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you already ARE the best partner in crime
(2:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I just hope im doing as amazing of a job as you are 😂
(2:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’re never too much honestly (regardless of how many times you may think you are)
(2:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: your amount of kindness, supportiveness, and lovingness (oh yeah + the sap) is JUSTTTT enough
(2:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if that wasn’t true it would have been very clear to you by my actions
(2:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I have no plans on saying bye felicia anytime soon 😘😘😘
(2:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I know we are not just friends, but I am so proud to call you my best friend
(2:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I have never met ANYONE (besides my parents) that comes close to understanding me as well as you do
(3:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: along with your pure intentions on guidance
(3:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: now I hope this doesn’t freak you out….. but if I had a son… I would definitely want him to follow on the same path you are currently on
(3:03 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you are LITERALLY mudering the gameeee
(3:04 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: couldn’t be more proud of all of your hard work thus far
(3:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: have an AMAZING DAY 🥰🥳😎🤓👨🏼‍💻
(3:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I love you so much
