(12:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: my friends from loyola will be there 
(12:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: female
(12:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it‚Äôs also super easy to get girls at a music festival to join your group
(4:12 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha 
(4:25 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes I‚Äôm well aware, my thoughts were that if just chandler was with us, that‚Äôd be quite a different vibe than if you had multiple other friends. Like I‚Äôve said chandler coming and visiting the both of us  for a weekend even just by himself would always be cool and I‚Äôd make sure to show him a great time! But 3 or 4 days at Lolla in Chicago just would be a little different to be honest, and it‚Äôd be easier for you and I to enjoy you and I time on a trip like that if there were other friends for him to break off with (momentarily / periodically) and allow us not to feel like we were responsible to do every single little thing with him is all. It‚Äôs like the difference between taking a ‚Äúcollege-y‚Äù group trip with some friends and taking a trip with your boyfriend... with one male friend tagging along you feel me lol?
(5:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah yeah I get it
(5:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Ill see what I can do
