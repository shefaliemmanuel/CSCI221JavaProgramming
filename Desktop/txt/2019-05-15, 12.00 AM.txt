(12:00 AM) Robert Seidl: And you still are very feminine and feel very strongly... which is good and you should.... 

The difference is that you are annoyed by people who let feelings blow them around like a leaf in the wind 😜😂
(12:00 AM) Robert Seidl: (Or in other words who let the feelings overpower reason and dominate their actions 
(12:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol you can have feelings you just don’t need to tell everyone about them
(12:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and act spastically  
(12:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Talking about their feelings is part of how many girls feel their feelings, and part of how they can come anywhere close to (a tiny version) of ‘reasoning’ through their feelings 
(12:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah but having other people’s opinions on their feelings
(12:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not thinking it through on their own 
(12:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: BIG DIFF
(12:04 AM) Robert Seidl: If girls couldn’t talk about their feelings to other girls... the world would EXPLODE 💥 
(12:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: tape their mouth shut see what happens
(12:04 AM) Robert Seidl: Ahhhh.... but you unintentionally bring up something very key... 
(12:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m actually watching a show about this society that collapses and these kids who were about to go off to college 
(12:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: have to rebuild it and 
(12:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no one can gossip or talk about anything anymore 
(12:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: because it’s just them in the town they grew up in
(12:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the girls are going batshit 
(12:07 AM) Robert Seidl: That girls are intensely “social” creatures (the far more social of the sexes) for evolutionary reasons... so their tribal hunter gatherer brain tells them that they NEED other girls opinions to help them decipher how they feel. If their feelings are too misaligned from the other females, they risk ostracism from the tribe.
(12:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Girls are so communicative of their feelings.. that they would find all kinds of ways to communicate their feelings even if they couldn’t talk.
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh i’m aware 
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s shown in this show 
(12:11 AM) Robert Seidl: (^interesting show lol)
(12:11 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha 
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like code 
(12:11 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahahahaha 
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: haha thanks i started it a few night ago
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: straight addicted 
(12:11 AM) Robert Seidl: See.... I know my shit 😜
(12:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha you always do😋
(12:13 AM) Robert Seidl: Aren’t you ever just a little like, wait wtf did he see this already or something 😂
(12:13 AM) Robert Seidl: (promise I haven’t though) 
(12:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahhaha honestly
(12:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no
(12:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they based it on the past
(12:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and you know the past
(12:15 AM) Robert Seidl: If someone doesn’t, whether they realize it or not, they then don’t know anything about the present.
(12:15 AM) Robert Seidl: And if they don’t know about how to decode the present, they won’t be in the best position they could have been in the future. 
(12:17 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s why without reading about past accumulated knowledge the only other formula for learning is trial and error.... which if you think about it — even that is you learning from the past, as the second it happens it’s then part of the past. 
(12:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: weird flex
(12:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol
(12:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: very true
(12:19 AM) Robert Seidl: So everyone that claims they don’t study or care about history.... ARE LYING or IGNORANT. They DO care about history. Unless they do the same things and expect different results... because that then means / = they are insane.
(12:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you would prob like this shit
(12:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Seen “The Society” on Netflix yet?
(12:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: https://www.netflix.com/title/80197989?s=i&trkid=13747225&t=amsg
(12:21 AM) Robert Seidl: As hard as it might be, if you sloww down, I’ll watch it with you (during the long distance) 
(12:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m at 7/10
(12:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ll rewatch the first ones with you
(12:22 AM) Robert Seidl: ^im writing down what I just texted you... so that I can use it while teaching my history class to convince young dumb 20 year olds that history does matter and they like history. 
(12:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAH okay okay 
(12:22 AM) Robert Seidl: Ladies of the class, be honest, do any of you like gossip? 
(12:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: by the time you’re teaching you’ll be saying it even better 
(12:23 AM) Robert Seidl: “Yess”
(12:23 AM) Robert Seidl: “Guess what, you like history” 
(12:24 AM) Robert Seidl: (And no I wouldn’t say it like that as I’d be aware it’d get me in trouble obvi)
(12:24 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂
(12:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yikes 
(12:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i need to warn your future female students 
(12:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i can’t imagine what you would tell them
(12:25 AM) Robert Seidl: About what.. to stay away from me or else they’ll have a problem with you? 😂😂😂
(12:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they would either be really scared or 
(12:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: confused 
(12:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no lmao about what they are capable of
(12:26 AM) Robert Seidl: If I was a good teacher... they would leave each class scared, confused, and re-evaluating life itself 😂😂😂😂😂
(12:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha
(12:29 AM) Robert Seidl: Damn you’re already that far 😂😂😂
(12:29 AM) Robert Seidl: 😕
(12:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i told you i’m addicted 😂😂
(12:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hey hey
(12:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we can watch the first episode and see if you like it
(12:30 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m going to get you addicted to billions... I want to pick that show back up 
(12:31 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ve already seen all of season 2 and a few episodes in season 4, but I figure I’ll hold off on them so that if you like it we can then watch it together.
(12:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you don’t watch shows from the beginning??
(12:33 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m not big on TV shows (I also often feel conflict  that it’s something that’s so basic especially if they’re the shows that everyone else is obsessed with) but with you they’d be even more fun 
(12:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha I’ve told you I’ll intentionally skip because I know I’ll get too addicted and then have too many episodes with which I can watch and waste time on 😂
(12:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah yeah but you like this show
(12:34 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s a rare show I’ll watch from beginning until end. 
(12:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we are very different in this way 
(12:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Well of course it’d be my PREFERENCE to watch every episode from beginning until end. My reasons (of not being tempted to spend  too much time on it) for doing it trump my preference and what I’d ‘most like’ to do.
(12:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i see
(12:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: is it on netflix
(12:37 AM) Robert Seidl: Nope. Don’t watch any though! 
(12:38 AM) Robert Seidl: I haven’t seen the first season so I’d like to go back and relaxingly enjoy from the beginning! 
(12:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg 
(12:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: plot twist 
(12:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m not spoiling it for you
(12:42 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol if I’d like it I might avoid it. Because one of the best ways to keep me disciplined and not binge on a show I like would be to watch each episode with you. Because if I have to save it for you then I’ll be able to no matter how much I want to see it.
(12:42 AM) Robert Seidl: But you ruined that by already being at 7 😂😂😂
(12:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: noooo
(12:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we can watch one episode 
(12:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: come onnnnn
(12:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Noooo! Because then that encourages me to binge to catch up!!!!!!
(12:43 AM) Robert Seidl: So just finish it!!!
(12:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but i want to watch it with you
(12:44 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s stupid 
(12:45 AM) Robert Seidl: Just watch the last one 
(12:45 AM) Robert Seidl: Because I’m not going to catch up 
(12:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😔
(12:45 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re being naughty 
(12:46 AM) Robert Seidl: You know how to get  me 😂
(12:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no i’m notttt
(12:46 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes. You are.
(12:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😈
(12:48 AM) Robert Seidl: You knew that just telling me I should wouldn’t persuade me to watch the show, but that you being sad might..
(12:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha 
(12:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: whatttttt
(12:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not me
(1:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wait are you going to watch it actually or not
(1:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this question is time sensitive 
(1:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i just finished the episode i was watching 
(1:34 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m not going to tell you
(1:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay i won’t wTch anymore 
(1:50 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂 ok... suit yourself 
(2:27 AM) Robert Seidl: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/98475212
(2:27 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m 100% in favor of everyone’s freedoms to exercise whatever religions, dress, etc. they choose.

But the claim that the hijab is a symbol of feminism or women’s rights / freedom, is hilariously ironic.
(2:36 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m always amazed at the lack of self awareness (and hypocrisy) required to make arguments like this. 
(2:37 AM) Robert Seidl: Am I missing something here? 
(2:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Oops forget you’re probably heading to bed about now so you’ll see this in the morning (in which case I wouldn’t have sent it because it wouldn’t be the typical type of thing I’d want to hit you with in the morning first thing 😂)
(7:02 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m like 15 mins into episode 1... these kids are fucking idiots. 
(7:04 AM) Robert Seidl: Are highschool kids this dumb now? I’m prettyyyy sure Reece would be like hey guys everything’s not ok we need to figure this out right now....
(7:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Well, at least the lucky fuckers still somehow have electricity for now..
(7:18 AM) Robert Seidl: God they’re so stupid. They should only be going for the most highly preservable foods right now. 
(7:23 AM) Robert Seidl: 28:10 to go episode 1 - Cassandra is in trouble, so is anyone who’s diabetic 
(7:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what episode??
(7:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: nvm!!
(7:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just woke up 
(7:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh my god please tell me I didn’t just wake you up....
(7:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it processed haha
(7:24 AM) Robert Seidl: 🤦‍♂️
(7:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no you didn’t 
(7:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i woke up on my own

(7:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: promise 
(7:24 AM) Robert Seidl: 😊
(7:24 AM) Robert Seidl: 😅
(7:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol sooo you’re watching it??
(7:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Character development seems like it’ll be good, mystery type plot, that’s usually enough to get anybody hooked on a show.... 
(7:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Including me unfortunately 😂
(7:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i appreciate the text updates about the show hahahaha
(7:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Even if It’s looking like I’m going to have hundreds of gripes with it logically 
(7:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: entertaining right??
(7:28 AM) Robert Seidl: No problem 
(7:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i didn’t like the first 2 episodes 
(7:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Not like you’ve seen it already or anything 
(7:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was just weird
