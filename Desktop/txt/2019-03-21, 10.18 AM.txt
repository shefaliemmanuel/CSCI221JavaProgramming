(10:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Have an amazing day 
(10:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hope you finished your reading
(3:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼from my roommate to georgia 
(5:25 PM) Robert Seidl: Heck ya!!!!!!
(5:27 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: eh Georgia and her roommate are besties 
(5:27 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she wouldn’t do that to christina 
(5:27 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but at least she might move out 
(5:28 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: nineka suggested her and evan moving out of the dorms lol
(5:51 PM) Robert Seidl: Ahhh gotcha 
(5:51 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes!!! I think she’s still going to move out!!!! Definitely don’t discourage it!!!!!
(5:52 PM) Robert Seidl: On your earlier texts: no, you were not overreacting about anything. I learn something new every single time I talk to you! I most certainly don’t know everything, I might believe in something strongly due to logic and evidence, but there’s always exceptions to truths. Veins of truth can run in untruths, AND vice a versa. At times life may be simple and have simple truths, but it’s simultaneously always complicated. The situation we spoke of coulddd be an exception (and even if it was an exception it also wouldn’t necessarily negate the norm). 

I thought about it a little more, and concluded that it would be wrong for you to ever try and avoid  someone who YOU feel is a true friend.  I want to make something VERY clear: whenever you feel that someone is a true friend that you value, I’ll always be happier if you do what you want to and what makes you  happy! 

It might not hurt to consider various possibilities about scenarios, human behaviors, and motives — or even to just keep those thoughts and considerations in the back of one’s mind... but after that, if YOUR “intuition” tells you someone is a good friend then that’s what  matters most!!! 

Furthermore, what also  matters to me is that I know how you feel about me. That’s all I need. Hypothetically if you were in a situation where every ex you’ve ever had suddenly appeared at once in the same place with you and the social norms called for you to be chill and politely hang out with them, that you’d still be carrying yourself well like the person I know you to be 😉😂😂😂
(5:56 PM) Robert Seidl: (Even if you ever hang out with someone you feel is just a friend and then they reveal at some point they clearly feel more towards you than just a friend... that still isn’t bad!!! In fact, it’s good!! After all you were able to recognize it!! And it would’ve been worse for you to miss out on someone your gut told you was a true friend! Plus, it’d also just allow you to sharpen your intuition even more! 
(5:57 PM) Robert Seidl: All my love kiddo hope your days going very well 😉
(12:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I would act the same around an ex regardless of if you were present or not 
(12:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if you ever have an doubts just remember how bad I am at lying 😂😂😂
(12:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: my day was kinda weirddddddd
(12:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: in lab arnis got too close to my face but I think it was an accident and he just excited about the subject because he backed away a lot after it happened 
(12:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: probably because of my reaction too
(12:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I hope you will always know that if I’m not into something I will let you know 
(12:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I won’t go hang out with my ex’s “just to see how they feel” if I ever have an doubts 
(12:56 AM) Robert Seidl: On the very last text it wouldn’t be that you’re hanging out with them to see how they felt, it’s just about you being 1000% able to hang out with anyone without me thinking at all negatively of it if you feel they are  a friend! Wouldn’t want you to have any regrets about possibly missing out on a friendship that mattered to you just because you had some suspicions after getting your goofy boyfriend’s perspective  😜


(12:58 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha you just can’t get away from that stuff can you!! I’ll tell you what... I’m glad I’m a guy 😂😂😂
(12:58 AM) Robert Seidl: (My last text was on the Arnis thing)
(12:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s actually the worst 😂😭😂
(12:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sometimes I wish I was one too
(12:59 AM) Robert Seidl: I don’t blame you!!!
(1:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Please don’t turn into a guy though I would cry a lot 😂😂😂😂
(1:01 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re a boss ass bitch I know you can handle all the guys who will always hit on you 😜.... so there’s no need for any below the belt  surgeries 😂😂😂😂😂
(1:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHAHA wait I thought you were into that 😏
(1:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Stop
(1:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Just don’t 
(1:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Don’t even joke about that... or I’ll make you call me daddy....
(1:03 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂
(1:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t what????? 😋😋😋
(1:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh god
(1:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: nothing’s worse than “fuck me daddy” or “you’re a bad girl” 
(1:04 AM) Robert Seidl: What’s your roommates name btw?
(1:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: insert repeated slapping sounds 
(1:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: carissa

(1:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: is what she goes by but apparently that’s not her real name 
(1:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you won’t have a girlfriend

(1:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Being my bad girl never goes out of style no matter who else uses that phrase sweetheart 😉😂😂

(1:08 AM) Robert Seidl: Pineapple was a typo 
(1:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: are you dropping hints
(1:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: .... 😂😂😂
(1:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha guess I have to make you hold a pineapple as I do you from behind 😂😂😂😂😂
(1:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I should leave a bowl of pineapple on my roommates desk with a note that says “thank me later”
(1:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: weird flex but okay 
(1:10 AM) Robert Seidl: No flexing, just shredded 
(1:10 AM) Robert Seidl: Its not supposed to make sense 
(1:11 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha if anything things like that are to make it difficult for you to look at that item the same ever again 😂😂😂😂
(1:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m not opposed let’s make it happen 
(1:12 AM) Robert Seidl: So whenever you see it, you automatically think of that session and get horny 😂😂😂😂
(1:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 9/10 I have a pineapple in my kitchen......
(1:13 AM) Robert Seidl: Perfect 😁
(1:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Beauty is you can use this philosophy with a lot of other things and get creative with it...
(1:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Likeee, if you had a belt you were wearing and I used it to pull you back and forth to me...
(1:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Orrr if there was a random book laying nearby and I spanked you with it...
(1:16 AM) Robert Seidl: See that’s just off the top of my head 😁
(1:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Also part of the beauty of different physical things in one’s home... like on the kitchen  counter...  at some point you’ll think about what you did on that one kitchen counter 😂
(1:18 AM) Robert Seidl: 🤔 hmm or made you read the book to me I remember we talked about that one!! Hahaha
(1:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Orrrr made you read the book to my (while I held it up for you).... while my dick was in your mouth 😂😂😂
(1:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHA
(1:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg we have to
(1:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Me* not my
(1:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the kitchen one worked 
(1:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the chair was even better
(1:21 AM) Robert Seidl: I think part of the chair was it was one of your first times bouncing on my lap with my dick inside you 😊
(1:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhhh that would make sense in that case haha 
(1:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I miss it soooooooooo much
(1:22 AM) Robert Seidl: I love it when you tell me how much you miss or want something 😁
(1:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: well I definitely miss and want you the most
(1:23 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s part of me 😉
(1:24 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s part of us 😁
(1:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I wish you were here 
(1:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I totally forgot to ask
(1:27 AM) Robert Seidl: See... normally I’d simply believe that if you’re long distance for very extended periods of time and not being intimate..... it doesn’t even feel like you’re  boyfriend and girlfriend. 

HOWEVER... when both parties are constantly craving, thinking about, talking about, and describing what they want to do to each other intimately... then it absolutely feels boyfriend and girlfriend 😁😁😁
(1:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: how was your day?? ☺️
(1:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Good!
