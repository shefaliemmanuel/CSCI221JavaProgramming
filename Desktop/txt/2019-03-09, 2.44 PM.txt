(2:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼12/10 would recommend
(8:24 PM) Robert Seidl: 
(8:24 PM) Robert Seidl: I have literally no idea what that just was that I sent as it was entirely by accident 
(8:25 PM) Robert Seidl: In response to the book: That makes it a must read if you give it that rating.
(8:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHA I called it 
(8:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: everyone was looking at my computer and I was like I can guarantee that was not purposeful  
(8:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: well I don’t know that much about economics so it was a lovely read for me 
(8:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you might get bored 
(8:45 PM) Robert Seidl: When it comes to things like that I like to constantly revisit the concepts otherwise some things can just be slowly forgotten 
(8:48 PM) Robert Seidl: I have an excellent economics expert to recommend to you as far as authors go by the way... Thomas Sowell; senior fellow at the Hoover Institute of Stanford.
(8:48 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha what if I sent you some not PG pic during that time?!
(8:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: do you just react to your own message
(8:49 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes
(8:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: my messages were hidden don’t worry
(8:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it said what type of message
(8:49 PM) Robert Seidl: Wanted to emphasize it 
(8:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: “digital touch”
(8:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if is said picture or text I wouldn’t have opened it
(8:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it*
(8:50 PM) Robert Seidl: I’m serious I think you might fall in love with his writing if you enjoyed an intermediate book on economics...
(8:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: anything specific by thomas sowell
(8:51 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha like all of it 
(8:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhhhhhh I wouldn’t be surprised if I did 
(8:52 PM) Robert Seidl: I’ve read a couple of his books several years ago. Currently reading “the anointed one” which examines the economics of socialism and big government”. 
(8:52 PM) Robert Seidl: *no quotations at the end 
(8:53 PM) Robert Seidl: “The vision of the anointed ones”
(8:56 PM) Robert Seidl: It’s very apropos given the current political climate and people actually pushing socialism as a good idea. Thomas Sowell is extremely academically focused though so all of his points are highly logical, scientific, and mathematic.  
(8:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: chubby is showing us Hungarian cartoons they are hype
(8:57 PM) Robert Seidl: Haha nice 
(8:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: sounds like someone I would enjoy reading basted on the last sentence 
(8:58 PM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(8:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: GASTONIA 
(8:59 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha ya you! 
(9:00 PM) Robert Seidl: You’re the person who would enjoy reading based on that last sentence.
(9:01 PM) Robert Seidl: I wouldn’t recommend it to many people but if you enjoyed a book on intermediate economics I think you would like it.
(9:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh hahahah
(9:02 PM) Robert Seidl: Recommend him*
(9:02 PM) Robert Seidl: They’re eyes would glaze over in seconds lol 
(9:02 PM) Robert Seidl: Their*
(9:02 PM) Robert Seidl: I’m at war with spell check right now......
(9:04 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: robby + technology = ?
(9:04 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: war
(9:04 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes
(9:05 PM) Robert Seidl: I’ll win too
(9:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and yet I still love you hahahaha
(9:06 PM) Robert Seidl: Would you still love me if I won the war against technology and pulled us all back into the Stone Age?
(9:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: somehow yes 
(9:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂
(9:08 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahahaha I don’t know if I believe THAT
(9:08 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: would I lie??
(9:09 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: when it comes to love? and technology?
(9:09 PM) Robert Seidl: I didn’t think so but that is quite an extreme hypothetical 😂
(9:11 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya? You’d Fred flinstone it up with me and not be at all sad I was the reason your new computer is powered by a dinosaur moving rock levers (like in the flinstone cartoons)? 
(9:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I would just create my own new one and just made sure I studied how to build one before you won 
(9:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it would be okay 
(9:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: or I could just forget that computers ever mean anything to me 
(9:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I said could not that I would
(9:48 PM) Robert Seidl: Because I love you, I would never take my war against technology far enough to deprive you of any of anything.
(9:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we just lost wifi for 30 min and my dorm broke down 
(9:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: everyone was running out of their rooms like do you have wifi 
(9:49 PM) Robert Seidl: It is a personal war, waged between me and things like “digital touch” on my iPhone 😂
(9:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha... were you just like, damn Robby might actually be winning this war!
(9:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahhaha basically 
(9:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I got scared
(9:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: no kidding 😂
(10:08 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya that’s quite a coincidence 
(10:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg I was on the phone with my parents earlier and you just hear “you’re a bad girl” being yelled in the background 
(10:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and the slaps scared chubby so much he jumped 😂
(10:45 PM) Robert Seidl: ?????

(10:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he slaps her ass 24/7
(10:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and calls her a bad girl 
(10:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s typically when I walk in and get sebastian so he doesn’t get scared 
(10:49 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahahahaha
(10:49 PM) Robert Seidl: Ohhhhh

(11:01 PM) Robert Seidl: I was very confused 
(11:02 PM) Robert Seidl: Them having to hear that in the background is pretty cringe though still 
(11:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i was like sorry for all the slapping noises and my mom was like why are they fighting 
(11:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: knowing my roommate and her situation 
(11:09 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: bless her heart
(11:09 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m sure my dad knew what was going on 
(11:11 PM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂
(11:12 PM) Robert Seidl: I would totally tell them you fucking freaks knock it the fuck off for 5 minutes 
(11:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I just walk in whenever it makes my company uncomfortable and they chill out 
(11:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it got old too quick 
(11:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we’re watching Hunt for the Wilderpeople
(11:53 PM) Robert Seidl: ￼Help.
(11:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: show me your new collection!!
(12:07 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼Didn’t know chubby made folk music...
(12:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(12:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he’s lol-ing 
(12:45 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼Zoom in and look closely at this remote 
(12:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Covered in drool and bite marks.... Winston was clearly trying to help me in the war against technology.
(12:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: looks like the doggos got a hold of the remote 
(12:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: awh I thought Winston was better than that
(12:52 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s the shape of his bones so he probably just didn’t know.
(12:52 AM) Robert Seidl: He doesn’t chew shoes or anything like that 
(12:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: bless his heart 
(12:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just hard plastic 
(12:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ^what he chews 
(3:31 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(9:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he’s too cute 
(5:20 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hi robby so I love talking to you, but what do you think about switching off between who’s staying up later? or maybe I could wake up earlier and we could talk then? I haven’t been really good about sleeping at set times since I got here so i’m trying to work on it since some of my finals are coming up in a few weeks 
(6:09 PM) Robert Seidl: Absolutely. 
(6:21 PM) Robert Seidl: Whatever works well for you I’m more than happy to wake up early or go to bed late. I think the time difference is inherently more unfair to you with Estonia being 8 hours ahead of here (and not vice versa) Each time it’s late in the evening for me it’s the middle of sleeping hours for you, while each. And each time you’re probably the most free with just getting done with classes I’m already in the middle of my work day.
(6:33 PM) Robert Seidl: So part of it is just the time difference is very inconvenient. When we would talk I just decided to make the decision to put off my after class work for later in the evening and at night, since it seemed that 430pm Central time was the tiny little window where you and I were both the most free (but then of course it was always easy for me to get carried away). 

Usually I had always liked getting my work done first right away when I’m most awake after class, instead of working until late at night when I’m most tired. I kind of just decided it was a worth it thing to make an exception this semester (otherwise I knew there’d be basically no other times)... but it just puts too much strain on you and your sleep. So in addition to me being willing to waking up however early or talk however late, we should also set a rule not to talk past 530pm CT no exceptions.
(6:35 PM) Robert Seidl: *willing to wake up* not “willing to waking up”
(9:20 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: would you mind calling me when ever is convenient at some point over the course of this week? we come come to an optimal solution for each of us- I would hate for our communication to become a burden 
(9:55 PM) Robert Seidl: Is there a time today that would be convenient for you?
(10:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m free whenever i’m just chilling with friends now - I don’t have class till 2pm tomorrow
(12:32 AM) Robert Seidl: Is now still an ok time to call?!
(12:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sure
(11:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: https://twitter.com/homero__lozano/status/1104871622270435328?s=21
(12:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow okay so my classmates were surprised Professor Dumas even met with me because normally he says he’s too busy to meet with students
(12:27 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(8:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol it’s snowing just for you!
(8:33 PM) Robert Seidl: Do you have any availability to do our skype session Thursday? I’m actually meeting with a professor around 4pm today as that’s the time she offered..
(8:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: No worries!! I actually can’t Thursday night since I have to leave my place at 6am to take a train to Tallinn and then fly to Norway!
