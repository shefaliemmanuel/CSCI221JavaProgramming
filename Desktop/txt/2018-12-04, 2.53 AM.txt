(2:53 AM) Robert Seidl: Not my plan to practice criminal law, but when a state attorney calls you do it if it’s workable in the schedule lol 
(2:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Plenty of people get recruited from WashU it’s not atypical at all plus if I’m being honest I have plenty of law school classmates who are farrr more brilliant when it comes to the law than me.
(3:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: But they didn’t ask him 
(3:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they asked you specifically 
(3:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t sell yourself short!!!
(5:18 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s the district that includes bloomington so that has far more to do with it
(5:18 AM) Robert Seidl: How goes the studying kiddo? 
(5:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Btw I’m so thrilled to see you in 16 days
(5:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just finished up for the night with kendall and nick 
(5:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: unfortunately my dumbass drank a large latte at 6:45pm
(5:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Kendall (kansas city) ended up dropping the boyfriend in kansas and is now just dating the guy from charleston and they are traveling around Asia for a month this upcoming summer
(5:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but he kept making jokes about what he was going to do to her when they got home like the unspoken kind of that makes sense and it would have been the most uncomfortable thing for a normal person but it was just odd to me
(5:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this lasted 45 min....
(5:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow 16 days it’s been about a month away in my head since I got the tickets hahaha
(5:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: can’t wait to seeee youuuuuuuu
(5:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha not sure I’m tracking on the text I question marked 
(5:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow that makes no sense i’m sorry

nick kept making jokes about what sexual activities he was going to do to kendall when they got home, but he wasn’t straight up saying it, in other words it was implied 
(5:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this would have made a normal person extremely uncomfortable for the length of time it went on for (45 min) but to me it was just odd 
(5:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and unnecessary
(5:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol I’d do the same shit to you only it’d be when other people either couldn’t hear or were unaware 
(5:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: which is totally okay
(5:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but don’t let everyone know what’s going on
(5:43 AM) Robert Seidl: So you’d like me to announce to everyone around us what I’m thinking about doing to you sexually. Got it. 
(5:43 AM) Robert Seidl: 😁
(5:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow, finally a man who understands what I want
