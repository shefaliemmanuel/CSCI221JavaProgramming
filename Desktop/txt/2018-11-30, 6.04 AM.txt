(6:04 AM) Robert Seidl: TCU = 7 girls for every few guys, football games, Greek life, constant craziness and stimulation
The Citadel = waking up every day at 530am or earlier, doing drill, constantly working and doing endless seemingly pointless tasks, staying in many weekends, and being subjected to a bunch of upperclassmen that seemingly hate you
(6:05 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s the initial reaction most high school boys  have when they visit the citadel or show up for the first time lol
(6:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: when you put it that way i’d pick TCU too 
(6:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: awhh maybe if they had more girls that went to the citadel it would seem a bit more appealing 
(6:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Nooooo
(6:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so turns out one of my friends founded the chess club at cofc lol
(6:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Plenty of girls at cofc
(6:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but that’s not part of the tour 
(6:20 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re right it’s not. Lol ya I wish he could see that side of it so he could at least have that to look forward to sophomore year. 

For him though I think it’s more that he’s used to sleeping / napping whenever, eating whatever, and having tons of freedom and a huge social life. 
(6:21 AM) Robert Seidl: If his gut reaction ends up being that he wouldn’t want to go there, it would be a disaster to persuade him into it. That would only make him more unhappy later and resent it even more.
(6:22 AM) Robert Seidl: Which could even potentially result in him being worse off in the end.
(6:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if this is your way of asking me to take your little brother to college parties consider it done hahahha 
(6:22 AM) Robert Seidl: No Hahahaha I’m not! 
(6:24 AM) Robert Seidl: I appreciate the offer though I know you would do that if I asked which is why I’m NOT asking 
(6:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: of course does he have to stay on campus or was this like a day tour 
(6:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: / would you maybe be kinda sad if he doesn’t want to go there
(6:30 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s the overnight “pre-knob” thing. 

Nahh that wouldn’t be fair to him. I just want him to make his own decision. 
(6:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol I can’t lie I’d selfishly be pretty happy for him to go there if he freely chose to though 
(6:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: awh that’s so nice of you a few older siblings I know would be really hurt if their siblings didn’t follow in their footsteps 
(6:37 AM) Robert Seidl: I don’t want him to follow in my footsteps. I want him to make his own. If any of the steps I’ve taken help him discover what steps are best for him to take, then that would be the best honor I could receive. 
(6:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what a mature response
(6:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol it’s what I’ve always wanted for my siblings... ever since I wore that cheesy as hell best big brother pin when Ryan was born 
(6:45 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m not always the beat big brother though..... and certainly not always mature 
(6:46 AM) Robert Seidl: I was quite immature for a long time (really until kind of recently haha) on Rachael and boys for example 😂
(6:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Best*
(6:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Not *beat
(6:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: having a hard time visualizing... you should send pictures lol
(6:48 AM) Robert Seidl: I think that one’s on my Facebook somewhere actually 
(6:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no ones perfect but you seem pretty close to it for the best big brother award 
(6:48 AM) Robert Seidl: I think I may have sent it to you actually 
(6:49 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahahaha I’m sureeeee they’d have a different opinion 
(6:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Probably no where close, but I hope someday they feel I wasn’t all that bad.
(6:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha might take a while 
(6:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼oh my god hahahahaha 
(6:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha
(6:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Have you not gone through my Facebook photos?
(6:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think I did when we became friends but I haven’t seen a lot of these 
(6:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: have you? 
(6:55 AM) Robert Seidl: If I ever went on Facebook, then I would have definitely looked at all of your photos. 
(6:55 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m not sure I still remember how to find people’s photos 😂😂😂😂
(6:56 AM) Robert Seidl: Was on recently for the first time in probably several months to respond to classmates on the messenger app
(6:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol I didn’t even see that one message you sent me forever 
(6:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh no 🤦🏾‍♀️
(6:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: there is a button that says photos on each profile 😂😂
(6:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: incase you were wondering 
(6:59 AM) Robert Seidl: I knewww that jeeezzzz I was kinda kidding 
(6:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i don’t believe you... 
(7:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha well your confidence in my Facebook navigation is a good reason for me to use it even lessss
(7:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: noooo hahaha 
(7:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m here if you get lost in the tech 
(7:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Plus after watching “the network” I don’t trust that fucking company with anythingggggg
(7:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Watching the network took me from being anti-Facebook to being radical anti-Facebook
(7:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow you’re just as bad as my mom- ever since i told her about the cloud she doesn’t trust any of it....
(7:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahahaha I’m right there with her
(7:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: noooooo
(7:03 AM) Robert Seidl: I actually toyed with the idea of deleting it altogether after I saw the network 😂😂😂😂
(7:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we are never watching a tech movie again 
(7:05 AM) Robert Seidl: Whatttt no but you love that stuff and I love seeing stuff like that that you love!
(7:05 AM) Robert Seidl: Ok ok I won’t delete it 
(7:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha
(7:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wait did I tell you about this 
(7:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼

(8:46 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh no shefali why were you up so early?! You could’ve only gotten like 4 hours of sleep! 😳
(9:11 PM) Robert Seidl: Haha I love you too though! 
(9:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: honestly it was just raining really hard- I promise I didn’t have anything to do lol
