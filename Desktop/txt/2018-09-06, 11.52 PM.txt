(11:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha the best prof always are!! 
(11:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: what do you mean??? i am just at full so I can drop a class if I need to if I go to Estonia next semester
(11:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol but you’re taking like 25 credit hours or something insane like that
(11:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: this morning was a mess I woke up at 7:48 for 8am which I had a huge test in and the prof ended up forgetting to make the test
(11:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: in the process of running to class I had coffee spilled on me and I hadn’t changed and still had my retainer in... but now i’m about to power nap so I can make it to Cherub tonight
(11:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hope your day/ afternoon is going better than mine!! 
(1:14 AM) Robert Seidl: I pictured what I think was a pretty accurate short movie of the above events. Since the professor ended up not making the test I couldn’t help but laugh at the following part with the coffee and the retainer 😂😂. (Lol so hope the coffee didn’t hurt too much) I must be really mean or maybe it’s just that I knew in advance that it was going to turn out ok with the professor forgetting. I have plenty of those days though so I’ll happily fill you in so you can have your revenge laugh “at” me. Enjoy tonight!!!
(8:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lmao please do fill me in
