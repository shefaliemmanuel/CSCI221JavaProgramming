(3:50 PM) Robert Seidl: They need to know that that’s what they’ll get treated as if they don’t go back to being a free space for everyone that isn’t so heavily biased. The money would talon in that situation, and they’d shape up in a jiffy.

(4:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I also like the interviewers comment about tech companies being like “oooppppps, sorry” every time something goes wrong
