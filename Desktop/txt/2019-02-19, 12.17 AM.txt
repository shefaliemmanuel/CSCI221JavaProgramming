(12:17 AM) Robert Seidl: The general concept of ownership of property isn’t nearly as strong in many other countries as it is in the US. The psychology that you’re  almost always a renter or a tenant in many other European countries has its roots in medieval feudalism and fiefdom where you never owned your own property and you were used to your role in that system as a servant to the powers that be as opposed to a free individual with inalienable rights which also extend to your property.
