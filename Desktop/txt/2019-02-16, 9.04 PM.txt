(9:04 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: any europeans teeth‚Ä¶..
(9:04 PM) Robert Seidl: Again.... free!
(9:05 PM) Robert Seidl: Simple economics. Quality costs. You‚Äôll pay for your healthcare one way or another.
(9:08 PM) Robert Seidl: https://edithsoot.wordpress.com/2018/03/19/my-broken-heart/amp/
(9:15 PM) Robert Seidl: From what I‚Äôve gathered so far, Estonian healthcare is highly privatized with family care entrepreneur oriented physicians providing a majority of the care..... vastly different than many other European countries who have socialized healthcare. 
(9:17 PM) Robert Seidl: I‚Äôm getting this from the 2001 Estonian Health Services Organisation Act which allows each hospital to operate a privatized entity under private law... vastly reducing costs. 
(9:18 PM) Robert Seidl: In which case it‚Äôs possible I was maybe too assumptive to assume that it was heavily socialized like the rest of Europe. 
(9:20 PM) Robert Seidl: So perhaps contrary to that one girl‚Äôs story, Tatsiana is right. If what I‚Äôm reading is true, then American healthcare is far more socialized than Estonia‚Äôs. 
(9:24 PM) Robert Seidl: Interesting stuff lol 
(9:25 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha everything I have gotten about their healthcare system I was told by Estonians
(9:27 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol ya so Estonia has approximately the population of Rhode Island 
(9:28 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: WOWWWZZZAAAA

(9:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: all of the text books here are published in the US
(9:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but constantly  compare US to Europe
(9:29 PM) Robert Seidl: 8 Estonia‚Äôs would = Chicago 
(9:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: im not sure why they wouldn‚Äôt utilize publications written from the european perspective
(9:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also I think Evan (my roommates best friend)
(9:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: is scared of he
(9:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: me
(9:30 PM) Robert Seidl: Many textbook publishers in the US are funded by the left or are even openly anti-US 
(9:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Your roommates *second boyfriend*
(9:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Good 
(9:31 PM) Robert Seidl: He sounds like a spineless soy latte 
(9:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I like walked into the kitchen to say something and he physically sank down into his chair
(9:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: soy latte‚Äôs are fucking disgusting
(9:33 PM) Robert Seidl: Going back to the 1930‚Äôs... taking control of all aspects of Academia and then the media was the main priority of socialists and marxists 
(9:34 PM) Robert Seidl: (To the soy lattes) That‚Äôs the point 
(9:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I know plenty of people who like them‚Ä¶. but maybe that is my problem üòÇ
(9:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: fun fact of the day:
(9:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: many estonians consider themselves russians
(9:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so all the people that I have been meeting that tell me they are russian
(9:38 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol... like a couple hundred thousand would be ‚Äúmany‚Äù Estonians 
(9:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: apparently only like 30-40 percent of them actually are
(9:38 PM) Robert Seidl: Right so around 400,000
(9:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha

(9:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: estonia is small
