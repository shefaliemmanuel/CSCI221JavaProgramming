(6:29 AM) Robert Seidl: If I was a girl I’d do a hundred different poses with it and have plenty of them be xxx with me sticking it out, up in the air, and spreading my ass... 
(6:30 AM) Robert Seidl: ...but I’m not a girl 😂😂😂
(6:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: doesn’t mean you can’t pose like one 😂😂😂
(6:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Noooo! The thousands of ways I’d love to see you there’s no way you’d actually want to see me do the same thing bahahaha!!!
(6:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you should send me the thousands of ways you’d love to see me by demonstrating 
(6:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh I want to see it 😂😍😍
(6:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂😂*
(6:32 AM) Robert Seidl: You don’t want them for anywhere close to the same reasons I want them!!!! 
(6:32 AM) Robert Seidl: You just think it’d be hilarious..
(6:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no i do 💕💕💕
(6:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they might be a little funny
(6:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but that’s all hahahahaha 
(6:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Wellllll unless my cock vanished and I all of a sudden have a vagina.... there’d be no purpose to the same poses. Like some of the types of xxx poses that would look hot for you would be you in a position looking like I was about to fuck you....
(6:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Unless you WANT to imaging fucking me with a strap on.... You DO NOT want me doing the same poses 😂😂😂
(6:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Imagine*
(6:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh btw side note... I’m pretty sure you have the most photogenic pretty pussy I’ve ever seen......
(6:36 AM) Robert Seidl: And that’s a lot of porn during middle school 😂😂😂
(6:37 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha feel free to just call me while I “cook”
(6:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: okayyyy if you say soooooooo but you’re welcome to pose me how ever you’d like since i’m not sure who would take those pictures for me in Estonia 😂
(6:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol are you cooking now

(6:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and you’re sweet

(11:53 PM) Robert Seidl: Multiple times cops would look at it, look at me, and be like “have a nice day, just drive slower” 
(12:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: must be nice 
(12:13 AM) Robert Seidl: That level of police  cordiality has not been afforded to me since I had to change to an Illinois license 
(12:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Legal history professor has ended class a half hour early each time.. professors at WashU don’t do that.. I could get used to this extra 45 mins in the middle of the day 
(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: is this the middle of the day for you??
(12:19 AM) Robert Seidl: I consider 11-5 the middle of the day 
(12:20 AM) Robert Seidl: I just hope he keeps it up because every single bit of extra time will be crucial to being able to get all work done that I want to 
(12:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m sure he will!! 
(12:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: my professors have always given a heads up if they are only going to do that for part of the semester 
(12:22 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya, lol not that you’d want to because you certainly don’t have to.. but if you feel like coming to one of my  classes on Friday you’d be welcome to.
(12:24 AM) Robert Seidl: It’d probably be boring AF for you though so I encourage you to just enjoy the cozy bed lol 
(12:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol i’m down 
(12:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i actually miss being in class so much 
(12:25 AM) Robert Seidl: You are going to be in academia your whole life I can tell 
(12:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i did part of chandlers homework today that’s how much i miss it
(12:25 AM) Robert Seidl: I love it 
(12:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂😂😂
(12:27 AM) Robert Seidl: I can always create a couple of classes I could teach to you while you’re here about various issues.... 😂😂😂
(12:27 AM) Robert Seidl: If you miss it thattttt much...
(12:27 AM) Robert Seidl: I legit have a giant dry erase board so I’d be ready 😂
(1:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg you know there’s no scenario that I would say no to that 
(1:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: let’s do it
(3:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼lol 
(3:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Pfff 
(3:56 AM) Robert Seidl: I can just hear the echo chamber of bitter lonely guys saying things like “only good looking, wealthy, or tall guys get girls”
(3:58 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s just an excuse they make to rationalize not trying to turn themself into a man of quality thinking they should jut have the girl they want offer herself up to them when they bring basically nothing positive to the table 
(3:58 AM) Robert Seidl: Sure some girls are shallow
(3:59 AM) Robert Seidl: Plenty are 
(3:59 AM) Robert Seidl: So are plenty of guys 
(4:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Who cares about those people though when it comes to dating... why would you want those types of people to want you?
(4:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Message for a lot of the guys that probably really resonate with that meme: 

if you want to attract quality people... stop whining and be the best man you can be. 
(4:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha i hear guys say ALL OF THE TIME how the reason they can’t girls is due to one of those reasons (looks / money). What’s even funnier is often if the guy is tall, he doesn’t think he’s good looking or successful enough. If the guy is good looking he doesn’t think he’s tall enough... and on and on. It’s a way of taking responsibility away from themselves. 
(4:14 AM) Robert Seidl: K I need to finish my workout byee
(4:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha
(4:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is so sad but so funny at the same time

(4:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: The Seidl’s,

Thank you so much for inviting me into your lovely home. I knew as soon as I met Robby that such a kind, thoughtful man would have equally generous parents. It was such a pleasure getting to know all of you. I hope to have the opportunity to spend time with you all again soon. 

I appreciate the lovely jewelry box, frame, and puzzle. It was quite thoughtful of you to think of a frame, so I could have a picture of Robby and I on my desk throughout my study abroad experience!

Once again, thank you for your hospitality. Please, do not hesitate to let me know whenever you all are in Charleston!

Love,
Shefali Emmanuel


(5:07 PM) Robert Seidl: Thanks!
(7:04 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: landed in philadelphia 20 min early 
(7:09 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(7:09 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god i just found this in my bag 
(7:10 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ll ship them to you!
(7:10 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m so sorry 
(9:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: landed in charleston!! 
(12:32 AM) Robert Seidl: You silly goose! I put it in your bag because I felt like it!
(12:33 AM) Robert Seidl: What’s the point of having it if I can’t share how it tastes with you?!
(12:33 AM) Robert Seidl: I know where to get them now haha 
(12:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh hahaha I felt so bad- that was sweet of you 
(12:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: super random question (I don’t mean to worry you, but I would just like to confirm): I know you don’t remember us have sex Saturday morning, but I just wanted to make sure that you felt confident about the condoms and they didn’t break or anything of the sort. I was ovulating on Saturday. I get my period in 2 weeks!!
(12:59 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes. Very confident. 
(1:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: perfect 
(1:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I just needed to hear it
(1:00 AM) Robert Seidl: If we had sex and I used a condom, I’m very confident I used it correctly. 
(1:02 AM) Robert Seidl: The fact that there were multiple condoms around without any cum in them also tells me I didn’t even orgasm 
(1:05 AM) Robert Seidl: I checked each one I found, and checked the garbage cans for any new ones (there weren’t any new ones in the garbage cans) the only new ones were the empty and clearly used ones (due to them having been fully stretched the way they would be only on a fully  erect penis)
(1:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Also, (even though I wouldn’t have tried to without one) can you confirm you remember me using condoms when we did it that morning?
(1:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes we used a condom every time 
(1:08 AM) Robert Seidl: Then we’ve confirmed it in multiple ways.
(1:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: great thank you 
(1:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I watched you put it on every time and you said you could tell I was double checking that you put it on right  
(1:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Excellent!!!
(1:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol sorry about all this 
(1:10 AM) Robert Seidl: 100% guarantee then 
(1:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hope you got a nap in today!
(1:10 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m going to probably go to sleep in a few hours until tomorrow morning around 6 lol
(1:10 AM) Robert Seidl: No worries!!!
(1:11 AM) Robert Seidl: I love that you care so much about double and triple checking and I love double and triple checking with you!!!!
(1:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Plus me having sex repeatedly each time I wake up when drunk almost always means that I wasn’t coming so I was still crazy horny 😂😂😂
(1:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m right there with ya haha going to pass the fuck out after this dinner 
(1:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahah i’ve never been happier to hear that you weren’t coming, but that makes sense for why we did it so much 
(1:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha yes it does 
(1:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you have put my mind at ease 
(1:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: gotta go be entertaining for these family friends at dinner 
(1:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: talk to you later 😛
(1:17 AM) Robert Seidl: 👍
(3:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Nikole should be in the middle of her period, but she’s just been spotting...
(3:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Yikes 
(3:37 AM) Robert Seidl: And she stillll hasn’t taken a pregnancy test yet??
(4:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she wants to wait till after her period is supusto be over...
(4:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she doesn’t know who’s it is if she is pregnant...
(4:05 AM) Robert Seidl: So did she reveal any info about how positive she was that she was or wasn’t using her birth control properly?
(4:06 AM) Robert Seidl: 🤦‍♂️ oh my lord 
(4:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no info revealed she’s going to take the test once she gets to Europe 
(4:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Ahhhh 
(4:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she has me so stressed out for me 
(4:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: even tho we used protection every time 
(4:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just like the thought of it right now
(4:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and she is no longer a student over there
(4:07 AM) Robert Seidl: We are more than ok 
(4:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so if she is she won’t have medical insurance 
(4:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also fun fact new test results have shown that plan B is effective up to 5 days after unprotected sex
(4:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the pill in amsterdam tends to cost A GRAND 
(4:08 AM) Robert Seidl: Damn 
(4:08 AM) Robert Seidl: On the grand 
(4:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: right?? and she doesn’t want to buy a $15 pregnancy test
(4:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: my guess is if she is pregnant she will get back with chavo 
(4:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: (european bf) 
(4:09 AM) Robert Seidl: No she just wants to not know 
(4:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: might have the baby
(4:10 AM) Robert Seidl: Remember when I told you getting pregnant from one person and then having someone else raise it is a veryyyy common and statistically significant female mating strategy....
(4:11 AM) Robert Seidl: Never thought you’d get a firsthand example that quickly
(4:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: me either 
(4:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she’s not even that worried 
(4:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she’s just like well i’m spotting!! at least it’s not nothing!!
(4:13 AM) Robert Seidl: Is the spotting a dark brown or pinkish color?
(4:16 AM) Robert Seidl: She might not be pregnant, but why she won’t just take the test after she was throwing up and had a bunch of unprotected sex is craziness. 
(4:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Spotting doesn’t necessarily mean pregnancy by any means, but it can occur when pregnant.
(4:19 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s the throwing up randomly like it was morning sickness that was most concerning 
(4:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I have no idea what color
(4:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what is the difference between color?
(4:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah im shook she still hasn’t taken it
(4:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah throwing up is never a good sign
(4:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I’m the only person she has told
(4:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so I feel like if she is
(4:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: her parents will be upset with me for not telling or something
(4:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: idk
(4:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: awkward position
(4:28 AM) Robert Seidl: No they won’t that’s not your place until it’s confirmed 
(4:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah ofc not right now but if it is confirmed and she doesn’t tell them
(4:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: nothings factual rn
(4:29 AM) Robert Seidl: If she doesn’t get her period then you’re maybe in that position if she’s still not telling them (depending on your relationship with them)
(4:29 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol we said the exact same thing 
(4:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Mr. Well’s and I are tight- he works on king street
(4:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I rarely saw her mom she is so busy
(4:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: idk I just dont want to be the only one that knows
(4:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: her and kylie used to be best friends
(4:34 AM) Robert Seidl: She’s made her decision on wanting to wait as I know you obviously tried to persuade her. So all you can do is wait. 
(4:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay cool
(4:35 AM) Robert Seidl: You did your job as her friend
