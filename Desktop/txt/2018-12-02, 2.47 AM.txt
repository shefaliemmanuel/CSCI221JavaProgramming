(2:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: when one member of a team creates an LLC on behalf of a team, 

1. they all need to sign the document even if it is submitted online
2. this document is where their ownership percentages reside

correct?
(2:48 AM) Robert Seidl: Depends 
(2:49 AM) Robert Seidl: What does on behalf of the team mean?
(2:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like if I were to make the LLC for my team and not have them sign anything 
(2:50 AM) Robert Seidl: One individual could apply for an LLC and just tell his teammates it was on behalf of them, and then not include them as owners. 
(2:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay cool that’s what I was asking 
(2:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they only way to include them as owners is to get their signature?
(2:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: especially if they have not even spoken about who owns how much percentage 
(2:53 AM) Robert Seidl: If the LLC terms and the contracts that you draw up do not include them as owners, and you do not orally or in writing communicate to them a promise that they would be equity or SH’s in any way, then you would be the owner.
(2:55 AM) Robert Seidl: What you’ve said and communicated to them orally and in writing is another piece of it. 
(2:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay cool thanks!!
