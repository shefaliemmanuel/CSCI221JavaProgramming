(4:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼but idk what to do since my mentor left their company last month
(4:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: thoughts 
(4:59 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re well within your rights to only do what you want to do and under no obligation to take on extra work that has not yet been agreed upon unless it’s what you wanted. One of the most important things (and this is something I’m continuously working on because I’ve always had a hard time with it), is being able to and knowing when to say “no”. It’s natural for anyone pursuing a schedule like you or I do to have to perform arbitrage. You can always politely inform someone that your academic etc. schedule is full. 
(5:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Have they paid you yet?
(5:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah I just started turning down stuff this year 
(5:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: paying me tomorrow
(5:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but if I wanted to it would be okay even tho my mentor left
(5:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: is it rude to my mentor if i say yes 
(5:05 AM) Robert Seidl: If the mentor left them on good terms then it should be fine. However, if you have work you’re doing for you mentor or related to your mentor, you would need to be sure that any new responsibilities you took on would not take away from or even give the appearance of taking away from any previously agreed to responsibilities with your mentor.
(5:10 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s also maybe ok if you’re unsure to check with your mentor. But some mentors who are also investors / associates (albeit unfairly) might be annoyed by you even asking the question, if it was something they expected you to already know that they wouldn’t want. It definitely depends on your relationship with your mentor, so make sure to trust your instincts 😉
(5:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Also, this person sent you an email. Your an extremely busy student, and you’re no longer currently employed. Therefore it’s completely fine etiquette to not have to respond to their email sooner than 24 hours. 
(5:17 AM) Robert Seidl: If you’re not interested in the moment, but you felt “who knows maybe I could be in the future”... then you can always utilize a ‘keep the prospect warm’ tactic, where you politely inform them of your busy schedule at the moment, but express a positive attitude and interest in them and staying in touch. 
(5:18 AM) Robert Seidl: ^just like what I’m doing with you...
(5:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha jk jk
(5:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Not at all how I feel about you. I’m just plain really interested 😂😂😂
(5:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so my mentor was just like I left that company nonchalantly 

I do have a lot of projects i’m doing for my mentor 

that’s what i’m afraid of him being like wtf no what are you thinking 

the guy that i’ve been emailing i’ve been responding to within the hour.... I also would be interested in side projects strictly based on their topic like if I was actually interested
(5:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha 🙄 ok bye
(5:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also how are you 
(5:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes trust your gut on that then. Just keep them warm as a lead and contact. Maybe even grab a casual lunch sometime. Often will just make them want you more and drive up your negotiating price. 

Doesn’t matter if you’ve been responding within the hour. Maybe you had other work come up etc. Just as long as you respond within 24 hours your always safe. If the person wouldn’t respect that when they know your circumstances then you wouldn’t want to work with them. (However for example, doesn’t mean it’s not ok to send early 430/5am emails to potential employers to let them know just how hard of a worker you are 😉)
(5:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Now when you’re actively doing work for someone, it can be a bit different.
(5:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Haha I’m good! 
(5:31 AM) Robert Seidl: A. Lot. Of. Class. 
(5:32 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ve never felt more “academic” lol
(5:35 AM) Robert Seidl: And ya many people would probably look at me and be like “you have no life that looks insane and miserable.” But I don’t really care. It’s what I have to do so I have no problem going into monk mode and doing it. 
(5:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: noted will respond at 3am 😛 and keep him interested
(5:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah 99% of the time I respond immediately if I’m doing work of anyone  
(5:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes late night can also demonstrate how late you’re working. Don’t be weird and set an alarm to get up and send it at a certain time though... 

(Ok ok I admit I have done that once)
(5:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god feeling “academic” is like the sexiest feeling ever 
(5:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh man I’d love to! But I have another weekend class unfortunately..
(6:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay good luck!! you’re going to killl those lectures!!
