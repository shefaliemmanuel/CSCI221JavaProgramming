(12:16 AM) Robert Seidl: But it would also probably make anyone speaking sound bad as well 
(12:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay I just got back from the bars maybe i’ll watch it tomorrow
(12:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes just wait! 
(12:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay good night
(12:17 AM) Robert Seidl: What time is it there?
(12:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Just trying to get a better feel for it 
(12:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Looking myself
(12:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Ah good! Get some early sleep! Sorry if I kept you up! 
(12:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Midnight 
(12:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Goodnight!
(2:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol sorry 
(2:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I legit passed out like that minute hahah
(2:50 AM) Robert Seidl: No that’s good! I’m glad! 
(2:52 AM) Robert Seidl: You’d have to make as much noise as possible in that situation... do not let them tie you or pin you down without biting screaming kicking punching clawing and tearing like a crazy person. Go for the soft zones. Eyes, throat, stomach, balls. 
(2:53 AM) Robert Seidl: I mean it though
(2:53 AM) Robert Seidl: I don’t like that it sounded like someone was against your door the other night 
(2:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Get that sleep kiddo! Goodnight! Love you! (put that phone away and on airplane mode) 😁
(3:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: rest assured! in the one self defense class I took the instructor said I was the only one who would survive out of the class!!
(3:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha 
(3:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I was on the phone with you- It could have just been someone going to the bathroom
(3:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he said people would get tired of fighting me 
(3:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: for flailing 
(3:03 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s a tiny bit re-assuring. 
(3:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yay 😁 
(3:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg wait I met a couple dutch people in aviation school tonight!!
(3:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they were like we can fly is to the Netherlands in their school plane 
(3:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t worry I’m not going with them
(3:04 AM) Robert Seidl: But exactly you just have to be so goddamn crazy, tenacious,  violent, and inflict as much pain as possible to the point that they say to themselves FUCK THIS I picked the wrong person I’m out of here 
(3:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: safety first!
(3:05 AM) Robert Seidl: Nooooo
(3:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah I’m positive I can do that
(3:07 AM) Robert Seidl: But remember you have to just never give up and use that brain of yours. The second they have you bound and gagged... and especially the second they get you in a vehicle or closed space that they control where no one can here you..... that’s where your dead. 
(3:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Have to fight like you’re going to die anyways. 
(3:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Hear*
(3:08 AM) Robert Seidl: No flying with Dutch flight students plane either 💥 ✈️ 💥 💥 
(3:09 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂
(3:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha that’s how I would die if I did
(3:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I made a friend from Italy and she’s going to make us some fancy dish!!
(3:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: v excited 
(3:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also got her sold on yoga so now I have a buddy
(3:10 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re not dying don’t even say that!!!! I’m not letting you. Ever. 
(3:10 AM) Robert Seidl: Nice!!!!!
(3:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I will try not to put myself in those situations lol
(3:11 AM) Robert Seidl: Ding ding ding. Yes that is 99% of it.
(3:12 AM) Robert Seidl: You do not want to be that fucking antelope wandering way away from the heard prancing over to the watering hole without a single care in the world.
(3:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so we’re going to an international student festival tonight and then a pub crawl tomorrow and then it’s sophia’s 20th birthday on saturday
(3:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Herd*
(3:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also I didn’t know this but Cider is fucking amazing 
(3:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Wait so you’re not going back to sleep?
(3:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I next am 
(3:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: never 
(3:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m letting the window stay open for a bit and then closing it and going to sleep
(3:13 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha ya I love cider 
(3:13 AM) Robert Seidl: My gosh sometimes I forget how little your time of drinking experience is 
(3:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we all probably shouldn’t be drinking from the same bottle but like prob 11 or 12 people asked to try my drink 
(3:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Cider has got no gutenz
(3:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: !!!!!!!!
(3:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s also really good for your skin
(3:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: mama emmanuel told me that one 
(3:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Often what I get if it’s an option instead of beer
(3:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s what i’ve been doing 
(3:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: estonian beer is far too strong 
(3:15 AM) Robert Seidl: And lots of gooten 
(3:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: estonia has lots of guten free options 
(3:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and lactose free
(3:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and vegan
(3:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: free
(3:21 AM) Robert Seidl: Here’s one for you shefali... explain to me how it’s possible that one can be vegan in account of animal cruelty and being a peta supporter... while also supporting late term abortions...????? 
(3:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: IM SCREAMING 
(3:22 AM) Robert Seidl: What?! U ok?
(3:22 AM) Robert Seidl: Someone at the door?
(3:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no omg like at your statement 
(3:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ve never said that to you before?? I used to say it all the time
(3:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was a meme
(3:23 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s what I thought but given the noises...
(3:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh haha
(3:23 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ve seen it probably 
(3:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh no i’m sorry 
(3:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s so sweet
(3:24 AM) Robert Seidl: So be screaming you meant..?
(3:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is one of them
(3:24 AM) Robert Seidl: By*
(3:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: https://youtu.be/RZwGig6lSxE
(3:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like to be shook from a statement 
(3:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the level of savageness in a statement 
(3:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha you would die I’ve induced some of the funniest looks and pro animal rights girls when I asked them how then they were for late term abortion 😂😂😂
(3:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Some very contorted and uncomfortable faces at the realization their life was a lie 😂😂😂
(3:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh boy 
(3:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Well one was a girl I was dating (this was one of the last dates I quickly decided), but she had told me earlier she was pro choice and I was just like “ok”.. and then later she was getting super passionate about peta and animal rights...
(3:28 AM) Robert Seidl: She thought I was a murderer for eating meat....
(3:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHA
(3:30 AM) Robert Seidl: I just listened, and then asked her, “hey, not saying I’m against people being able to have abortions, but what up to what point do you think it’s ok to have an abortion? 
(3:30 AM) Robert Seidl: She said, “at any time!” (Excitedly)
(3:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ooofffffff
(3:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s like in that little dicky song 
(3:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: pillow talk 
(3:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: (that’s how I picture your conversation about this going)
(3:32 AM) Robert Seidl: I responded, “huh, that’s real interesting... so you’re cool with killing human animals when it’s scientifically proven they have thoughts, feelings, and pain, and are viable in the late term... but you’re not cool with killing deer that have zero conscious thought as proven by science but are extremely tasty as proven by my mouth?”
(3:33 AM) Robert Seidl: It was NOT pillow talk. I did NOT sleep with her.
(3:33 AM) Robert Seidl: (Her face looked like I had just chopped a live deer up in front of her)
(3:34 AM) Robert Seidl: (Mouth wide open)
(3:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no but i’m saying they way the girl in the song was like getting mad at him for not being vegetarian 
(3:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Silence for a good 7 seconds trying to find words 
(3:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Ohhh haha ok
(3:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Haven’t listened to it enough times I guess
(3:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha that sounds really funny 
(3:35 AM) Robert Seidl: You would’ve seriously died. 
(3:35 AM) Robert Seidl: BUT... 
(3:35 AM) Robert Seidl: It gets better. 
(3:35 AM) Robert Seidl: She started to tear up. 
(3:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: OH MY GOD
(3:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Then turned super angry all of a sudden, and proceeded to yell at me for thinking I had any right to come between a woman and her body. 
(3:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: .......
(3:37 AM) Robert Seidl: To which I replied well in that case you definitely have no right to come between me and my tasty venison and beef. 
(3:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Which keeps me healthy...
(3:38 AM) Robert Seidl: And helped my ancestors brains evolve...
(3:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she sounds like jackie telling me our brains don’t need large amounts of fat to be healthy.....
(3:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Later that night she tried to hook up with me. I said I was feeling sick all of a sudden and drove her home. 
(3:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Here’s the craziest part... she was a doctor....
(3:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Well Med student at WashU I guess but 2 years in so clearly smart enough to get into one of the top 5 Med schools in the country 
(3:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: must have been all that meat you are 
(3:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ate*
(3:41 AM) Robert Seidl: By the way... I’ll give you a special reward (maybe sexual) if you can ever find me a vegan lefty who’s NOT pro late term baby murderer 
(3:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: challenge accepted 
(3:42 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha I think I remember making that joke and she was like “see it’s bad for you” or something 
(3:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Granted this is 2 years ago so i don’t know but that vegan / abortion convo was seared into my brain 😂
(3:44 AM) Robert Seidl: You could tell she was using every bit of confirmation bias she could muster to not allow the logic to enter her brain 
(3:44 AM) Robert Seidl: I bet there’s a few vegans who aren’t pro late term out there....
(3:45 AM) Robert Seidl: They’re libertarians 
(3:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh wait I think I got one
(3:46 AM) Robert Seidl: No way..
(3:46 AM) Robert Seidl: That quick?!!
(3:47 AM) Robert Seidl: (Also you never need to do anything to get sexual favors but we can pretend) 
(3:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼i’m still talking to her but this is what i’ve got so far 
(3:48 AM) Robert Seidl: Who dis?
(3:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: jackie the vegan 
(3:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: girl I was going to live with next year 
(3:49 AM) Robert Seidl: Ok ok 
(3:49 AM) Robert Seidl: So she’s pro life? 
(3:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Like I’ve told you I’m personally pro life after anything after a couple weeks minimum but I just can’t say I’m positive on limiting others to anything after conception. 
(3:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Remind me again why you’re not living with her?
(3:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Unless the window cooled things down sufficiently then go to bed..
(3:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 1st I really don’t like her and discovered this over the course of last semester 
(3:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 2nd she wanted to get a 3 bedroom apartment downtown and have her mom come and stay whenever 
(3:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but have each of us pay for 1.5 bedrooms 
(3:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: when I would have no one staying in that extra bed room
(3:53 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya that’s a BS deal.
(3:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: when my friends come to visit they always sleep in my bed
(3:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and on the ground if they are guy friends 
(3:54 AM) Robert Seidl: She wants the extra bedroom.. she pays for it.
(3:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah exactly 
(3:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so I said no but I would ha e felt confident in her finding a great place to live while I studied abroad so 
(3:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s what I was still going to suffer through it 
(3:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she’s one of the few people that has similar living standards and doesn’t constantly get fucked up 
(3:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: at cofc 
(3:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Hmm. Ya that’s tough. Tough to find anyone anywhere remotely close to your level on anything at Cofc probably 😂
(3:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(3:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m looking for non party people in the 13th party school in the nation 
(3:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(3:59 AM) Robert Seidl: Heyyy!! Nice Jackie has a brain and a soul!!
(3:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ll accept my reward in July 
(3:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and I got it on my first try
(4:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Although to say as soon as it can survive... with modern technology, pretty much means a short time after conception since you can have pretty much lab babies now...
(4:01 AM) Robert Seidl: But I don’t want to not pick at her logic since she got the critically important common sense part down 😂
(4:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ...... I think she met your requirements 
(4:02 AM) Robert Seidl: She did. 
(4:02 AM) Robert Seidl: You won. 
(4:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 💁🏽‍♀️
(4:04 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m telling you shefali most people who have just a basic amount of common sense (not all maybe but most) would end up being 100x more “conservative” / “republican” if they actually did deep dives and really fleshed out the issues..... if they were able to do so with an open mind and not revert back to their old confirmation bias
(4:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol hence why there’s the old adage democrat when young and conservative when old
(4:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I see!!
(4:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: my roommate is def a pro choice kinda girl
(4:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I shouldn’t make that assumption 
(4:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but I feel fairly confident 
(4:08 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re not assuming she is... you’re just assuming she probably is (which entails “might be”)
(4:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I suppose 
(4:09 AM) Robert Seidl: I miss the hell out of you 
(4:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Goddamn this is hard. (And when I say it’s hard I do NOT mean it’s hard being with you.. that’s easyyy and great to me and I wouldn’t have it any other way!!! What’s hard is just not being able to see you in person when I want to so badly).
(4:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I miss you moreee 
(4:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I’m really thankful I can still keep you in the loop of what’s going on over here tho
(4:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just like being able to communicate with others so far away is such a luxury 
(4:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and that too very frequently 
(4:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Always feel free to detail  every little bit of “how” you miss me 😜
(4:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: let’s seee 
(4:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I miss seeing you swing your sick around 
(4:14 AM) Robert Seidl: We’re very lucky for so many things.

(4:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Nooo I need to not swing my sick around you anymore!!!!

(4:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and your sent filling the bed sheets
(4:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: If we couldn’t talk hands down I would miss our conversations the most 
(4:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that would be a no brained

(4:17 AM) Robert Seidl: *scent

(4:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: something like that happened yesterday and I was the only one on my page
(4:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha
(4:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was like a weird split second realization 
(4:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: do you want me to keep going?? lol
(4:19 AM) Robert Seidl: As much as I loveeeee our conversations I love being in person with you  99^99th power times more 
(4:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Don’t calculate it...
(4:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: being in person is always the ultimate goal 
(4:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: better break out your scientific calculator 
(4:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 3.697296e+197
(4:20 AM) Robert Seidl: I mean, always yes I do haha... but right now, get some rest seeetheart
(4:22 AM) Robert Seidl: I just want to always encourage you to never hold back even the tiniest bit in saying any little thing to me in your mind and giving me every little bit of you I can get!!!!!
(4:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼help!! I don’t understand!! 😂
(4:23 AM) Robert Seidl: That extends for when we’re in person too. 
(4:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha
