(4:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah and cruise around that neck of the woods 
(4:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: do you have any recommendations 
(5:18 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s been a while so I’ll have to dig up some of the names of some of the places! 
(3:33 PM) e::  seems like your mom agrees with me that you looked good in the pictures from last week 
(7:33 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha dear lord she’s just saying that because I rarely do lol. You definitely do not have to do that especially on FB 
(7:34 PM) Robert Seidl: You just do or don’t do whatever you want and I would take the blame for it if she says anything 🤦‍♂️
(7:34 PM) Robert Seidl: Travel safe today!! Love you very much and hope you don’t mind that I snuck in your suitcase!
(7:42 PM) Robert Seidl: Send me updates!!
(8:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha thank youuuu 
(8:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: normally I wouldn’t be the happiest camper if one of my bags didn’t have anything I packed, but I would be the furthest from upset in this case 😉
(8:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I just got through security 
(8:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I love you so much- hope you’re all caught up from being distracted from studying by me 
(9:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: OH MY GOD this adorable little Yorkshire terrier is crying because the owner won’t pay attention to him 😭😭😭
(9:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the bag that he’s moving in keeps on moving like it’s about to roll over
(9:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: because he wants to be out so bad
(11:04 PM) Robert Seidl: I have my fingers crossed you’ll somehow have a dog next to you even though they don’t usually allow that on international flights lol 
(11:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: leaving charleston!
(11:13 PM) Robert Seidl: Ok! Fly safe text me when you get to NYC!
(11:14 PM) Robert Seidl: Also I’m so sorry shefali... I know you must be absolutely crushed that you’re going to miss the super bowl...
(11:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: landed in charlotte! next stop: Heathrow 
(11:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: awh man I always loved going to those food parties with my friends
(11:51 PM) Robert Seidl: Ohh you’re going Charlotte to London?! Nice
(11:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: there was always some strange chanting and yelling going on through the tv 
(11:52 PM) Robert Seidl: They’re not.. food parties.. 🤦‍♂️
(11:52 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha
(11:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeahhh I got really lucky to go straight from charlotte 
(11:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: everything else was JFK or O’Hare
(11:54 PM) Robert Seidl: ...if you went to o hare I’d have had to consider going to Chicago just to say hi through the gate 😂
(11:54 PM) Robert Seidl: Now that I think about it though that’d be some kind of torture....
(11:55 PM) Robert Seidl: *through the security gate*
(11:55 PM) Robert Seidl: There’s actually people out there who think if you’re rooting for Tom Brady and the patriots that that means you’re a racist.... 
(11:56 PM) Robert Seidl: People are so fucking stupid 
(11:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that would have been so cruel 
(11:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: there’s a slight chance I wouldn’t have made it on my flight 😂
(11:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ¿¿¿¿¿how?????
(12:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I had to share since this is the coziest fit ever 
(12:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(12:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Because Tom Brady and trump have been close friends for 15 years (nothing to do with politics - trump has called to wish Brady and his family happy birthday and merry Christmas ever year) and trump gave Brady a MAGA hat and Brady had it in his locker. Brady said quote “I don’t endorse all of his political views but he’s a great guy and always been a great friend and has always supported me.” —— so now trump haters believe rooting for the patriots is racist. 
(12:04 AM) Robert Seidl: The idea that someone with as much star power as Brady could’ve humanized trump as a “good guy” is what really ticked trump haters off. Doesn’t exactly fit with their narrative that he’s satan..
(12:05 AM) Robert Seidl: I thought that was a picture of Ernie at first for a split second and was like “how’d you..”
(12:14 AM) Robert Seidl: So it also pisses the hell out of trump haters that Tom Brady is a consistent example of greatness within an American individual. He stands for the truth that you can achieve anything in life if you work hard enough. 

Notice that once again: doesn’t exactly line up with the left’s belief that people only achieve success based off of privilege and that without privilege you can’t ever become more. There’s no such thing as the American dream of relentless hard work and eventual success and greatness. There’s only the haves and the have nots and you’re stuck wherever you start. 
(12:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Someone giving people belief in themselves as individuals capable of achieving anything with enough hard work, is a dangerous threat to an ideology which wants to destroy people’s belief in their strength as individuals so that they’ll then rely on government or the state to be in charge and take care of them. 
(12:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wowowow is SO DRAMATIC  
(12:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you can be friends with people who’s views you don’t align with 
(12:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg I have 2 empty seats next to me
(12:41 AM) Robert Seidl: ^not according to a shockingly large number of trump haters
(12:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: best international flight. ever.
(12:42 AM) Robert Seidl: (Keep in mind I haven’t met a trump supporter who has a problem being friends with democrats)
(12:42 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s actually because I’m going to be sitting in one of them..
(12:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I wish I could carry Ernie on my shoulders like a scarf 
(12:42 AM) Robert Seidl: Hold on...
(12:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Just let me get out of this suitcase..
(12:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I got a seat for you 😉
(12:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s on my lap contrary to what you’re thinking 
(12:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Your suitcase is kind of out the bottom of the baggage department so it’s going to take some maneuvering...
(12:44 AM) Robert Seidl: No. You’ll be sitting on MY lap.
(12:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ill make them taxi the plane till you get out 
(12:44 AM) Robert Seidl: We would totally hook up on an international flight 
(12:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t worry 
(12:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: multiple times
(12:45 AM) Robert Seidl: What would you do if I suddenly walked up to you and casually sat down in the seat next to you..?
(12:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I would literally be jumping out of my seat and would wrap my self around you and not let go 
(12:46 AM) Robert Seidl: Ok just in case I actually got your hopes up, I don’t know if I’ll be able to get out of this mountain of suitcases..
(12:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: in that case i’ll get in a suitcase too 
(12:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omw 
(12:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼i’ve never drank evian before... but i’d suck your dick for a bottle of it 😉
(12:49 AM) Robert Seidl: You saying “I’d suck your dick” even though just through text.... literally just got me hard.....
(12:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha the things i’d do if you were sitting next to me 
(12:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha I literally have a full hard on right now 😂
(12:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 👅👅👅
(12:50 AM) Robert Seidl: You talking explicitly sexual is painfully sexy... 
(12:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Because you’re so innocent so the dirtier you are with me the hotter it makes it.
(12:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you did get the frye reference right 😂
(12:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Ohhhh this was a movie quote or something....
(12:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: well damn I don’t wanna be all hot and bothered for 7 hours and there’s nothing I can do about it 
(12:52 AM) Robert Seidl: I just thought you felt like saying you’d suck my dick 😂😂😂😂
(12:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAA
(12:52 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m going to pretend you just felt like talking about sucking my dick 😂😂😂😂
(12:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I mean don’t get me wrong there’s not a moment I wouldn’t love to suck your dick 
(12:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this one was also just a reference to a meme 😂😂😂😂😂
(12:53 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂😂
(12:53 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m just pretending what I said I was pretending 😂
(12:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay I won’t send you the memes 😂😂😂😂
(12:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I got the audio book of the Art of Seduction 
(12:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: maybe it will have some tips 😛😉
(12:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂😂😂
(12:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Actually ya it’d be incredibly sexy for you to incorporate different versions of the concepts with me 😁
(12:58 AM) Robert Seidl: Although don’t use the manipulation in it for evil please use it for good and to bring us to an even crazier love for each other and because you actually just want to make things more sexy between us. Also ignore the parts where it talks about “withholding” to build tension because you already did that to me (albeit unintentionally) 😂😂😂😂
(12:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHAHAHA
(12:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m hearing “please don’t be a psycho” 
(1:00 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ll always be able to see through any psycho ness anyways and that’s just the opposite of you. So if you tried to do some of the more manipulative / amoral tactics it’d probably backfire.
(1:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t even think that way 
(1:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya... and even though the seduction process never stops..... you’ve most definitely already seduced me.
(1:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: If I ever even tried I would probably get bored or think it was too much to keep up with 
(1:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂
(1:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh yeah?? I think I have a long way to go 👅
(1:03 AM) Robert Seidl: We both have a long way to go. The intensity, passion, and exploration of our sexuality together has only just begun 😉 

I’ve always said that 😜
(1:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: The Univeristy of Tartu already gave out homework and reading assignments to do like 5 chapters of a book for one of my classes... I have about 6 other classes assignments to do  

Classes start in 2 weeks... I’ve been attending the wrong college 😍
(1:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: gotta meditate together when I get back 
(1:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: bout to take off catch ya on the flip side babe
(8:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Will try and stay awake while reading until your plane lands in Estonia  (might fall asleep though at some point lol). Message me when it does though!
(8:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Or London.
(9:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just landed in London! 
(9:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: well halloween 2 years ago now 
(9:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: which seductive character do you think you are
(9:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i tried to sleep since it’s the top of the morning here now 
(9:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I used to be obsessed with reading Lord Byron’s works in middle school 
(9:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Which do you think I am? 
(9:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Good! (On your landing in London)
(9:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Personally I like to think that I flow between a variety of the characters. 
(9:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(9:18 AM) Robert Seidl: What I think Robert Greene does well is present interesting ideas in a thought provoking way while weaving in history. 
(9:20 AM) Robert Seidl: I actually think one could strongly debate the organization or classification of his ideas. I simply look at it as the classification / organization that made sense to him..... not necessarily the end all be all structured template on how to most efficiently think about seduction. 
(9:22 AM) Robert Seidl: Since his mind tends to wander all over the place I simply let my mind and imagination wander while I read his books. Im focused more on absorbing new intuition and creative ways of thinking about things, and less focused on absorbing his structure as a go to rational formula.
(9:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m on the Ideal Lover right now 
(9:23 AM) Robert Seidl: If I’m doing ok you’ll see a little bit of me in most of them (maybe minus a few) 
(9:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya and patriots won.
(9:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: shocker 😂
(9:25 AM) Robert Seidl: In 2004 (yes I was in 8th grade) I told everyone my prediction was that Tom Brady would win 7 Super Bowls before he was done. Everyone looked at me like I was nuts. Now it’s a real possibility.
(9:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this was his 6th??
(9:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes 
(9:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: are you the one behind all of the Simpson’s predictions????
(9:26 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s as many Super Bowls as any other TEAM has won in their history.
(9:27 AM) Robert Seidl: I could be. A strange amount of my predictions seem to come true. 
(9:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Maybe one day someone will say a Simpson’s episode predicted me 😂😂😂
(9:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wowzaaaaa 
(9:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha 
(9:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I love when I walk past a group of indian people working at the airport
(9:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and they think i’m American and don’t speak any indian languages 
(9:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so they start talking about me 😂😂😂 
(9:30 AM) Robert Seidl: You should say something back in the language to see their reaction!!!
(9:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Love you sweetheart. I’m headed to bed. Fly safe to Estonia and message me when you’re there!
(9:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and then I respond in hindi 
(9:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha that’s hilarious 
(9:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sweet dreams 
(9:40 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d love to see that 
(9:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: thanks for staying up and chatting 🥰
(9:40 AM) Robert Seidl: No problem! Haha I probably on had a little more in me won’t lie dozed off in my book a few times 
(9:41 AM) Robert Seidl: Only* not “on”
(9:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: awhhhhhh 
(9:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: get some rest
(9:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hope you’re feeling better 
(9:41 AM) Robert Seidl: Night sweetheart. 
(9:41 AM) Robert Seidl: All my heart. 
(9:41 AM) Robert Seidl: You have it.
(9:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: all my love is yours.
(3:32 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha bet you’re thrilled 
(3:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: only think that woke me up from almost passing out in the middle of the day
(3:39 PM) Robert Seidl: You’ve trained for feeling like you’re jet lagged. It’s simply like you just spent a weekend with me.
(3:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahhh that’s how i’m wide awake rn 
(5:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼￼￼￼
(5:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Tatsiana’s doggo 
(5:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: her daughter and I enjoyed the chocolate you snuck in my bag 
(6:34 PM) Robert Seidl: Very soulful eyes 
(1:00 AM) Robert Seidl: So enjoying your first hours in Estonia?!
(1:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I went to sleep at 6:30 pm and then woke up at 8:45 thinking it was 8:45 am and got ready to leave for the train station....
(1:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so now i’m wide awake and it’s 1 am bahaha
(1:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha 
(1:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she thought it was the funniest thing ever
(1:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Nooo! I should have given you a bunch of melatonin!
(1:02 AM) Robert Seidl: You need to go to sleep right now m!
(1:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Now*
(1:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ve been sleeping!!! 
(1:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Go back to sleep. 
(1:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ve been rolling around in bed for like an hour hahaha
(1:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Better extra sleep to get back in schedule.
(1:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I tried 😩
(1:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Meditate with your eyes closed at least since that has rest benefits
(1:04 AM) Robert Seidl: Bye, go to sleep 😉
(1:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: noooo
(1:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: robbbbyyyyyy
(1:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t do this to meeeee
(1:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: pleaseeeee
(1:05 AM) Robert Seidl: Just picturing you saying that in a pleading voice reeled me back in so quickly 😂😂😂
(1:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha good 
(1:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m super hungry but I know if I leave my room the doggo and cats will start making noise 
(1:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so I ate everything in my suitcase 😂
(1:06 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂
(1:06 AM) Robert Seidl: You need to sleep so you don’t wake your hosts up!
(1:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ve been sleeping don’t worry 
(1:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they are on a different floor
(1:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Then grab some food so you can sleep a bit more 
(1:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Do you have obligations today? You don’t have class I’m pretty sure right..
(1:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I have nothing to do tomorrow besides get on a train from Tallinn to Tartu tomorrow morning
(1:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: orientation starts on the 7th
(1:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I do wanna open up a bank account and get my phone service situated but that’s all 
(1:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Tomorrow morning as in a few hours or tomorrow as in actually tomorrow
(1:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: tomorrow as in 7. hours
(1:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Wait... phone service isn’t situated...  
(1:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is wifi 
(1:10 AM) Robert Seidl: Is this blowing up our bills?
(1:10 AM) Robert Seidl: Ahhh
(1:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I just have to get an Estonian sim card 
(1:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s so cheep like 15 euro for unlimited talk and text 😂 
(1:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: verizon was not here for it 
(1:11 AM) Robert Seidl: They’re just suckering Americans who they know won’t be able to figure out or go through the hassle of getting the Estonian SIM card
(1:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: basically hahaha but the uni gives us SIM cards and Sauna memberships i’m pretty sure 
(1:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: did you see whatsapp
(1:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: your fav app
(1:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so I think the Ted Bundy Tapes is actually doing great work for girls 
(1:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya?
(1:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 2 sat next to me while we were waiting to board and one was talking about how she used to go to random guys houses like from bars 
(1:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: or just through like going on a date from tinder and going home with them 
(1:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol, ya she’ll probably forget / still do that eventually 
(1:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but in the middle of telling her story about how she went to some finish guys hotel room since they were both catching flights with lengthy layovers 
(1:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she said he was ugly but he was nice 
(1:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what if he was ted bundy 
(1:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she was like what if I ended up fucking ted bundy 
(1:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Translation: he was there and kept trying and I was horny so I went home with him 
(1:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she ended up never sleeping with him or at least that’s what she told her friend 
(1:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she was like times were not this scary 5 years ago 
(1:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: WHATTTTT
(1:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Sure, she might not of... but a girl only goes home with a guy if she’s at least considering the possibility 
(1:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s always been like this just not a direct spotlight was shown???????
(1:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: anywho that’s why I think the documentary might be a positive influence on stupid girls 
(1:20 AM) Robert Seidl: She doesss realize Ted bundy was from the 80’s right...... 
(1:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I have no idea.... I hope so
(1:20 AM) Robert Seidl: But yes agreed positive influence on stupid girls 
(1:21 AM) Robert Seidl: Times have never been less scary in terms of that stuff if you’re smart and focused on being safe... but times always have been and always will be scary AF for dumbasses 
(1:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha yeah people amaze me  
(1:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so interesting 
(1:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Would you be mad at me if I am feeling desperate for some  quick power sleep right now haha?
(1:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg no goodnight 
(1:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sleep well 💤
(1:25 AM) Robert Seidl: (Not that I’d of cared if you were mad about that 😝)
(1:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Love you 
(1:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Try and get some sleep yourself 
(1:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha love you too
(1:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ll try again I guess... 😂
(7:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼￼￼
(7:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we walked by and thought this good boy was a statue 
(8:13 PM) Robert Seidl: I want him
(8:13 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol you looked between his legs?
(8:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: looked between his legs???
(8:16 PM) Robert Seidl: How’d you know it was a boy?
(8:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh i’m just guessing haha
(8:16 PM) Robert Seidl: Is a masculine looking breed
(8:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: okayyy so maybe a good boy
(8:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: prob a good girl 
(8:17 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol just busting your balls 
(8:17 PM) Robert Seidl: Ha
(8:17 PM) Robert Seidl: Ha 
(8:18 PM) Robert Seidl: Or labia 
(8:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(8:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(8:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha 
(8:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: how’s your day going
(8:18 PM) Robert Seidl: Great! 
(8:19 PM) Robert Seidl: Getting a lot done. 
(8:20 PM) Robert Seidl: I’ll be able to help you prevent unions from forming in any businesses you start
(8:20 PM) Robert Seidl: You’ve gotta delete that text though 😂😂😂
(8:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahhahahahaha 
(8:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the last one?? 
(8:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: delete evidence???
(8:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think not 
(8:24 PM) Robert Seidl: No... “delete it because you’d never consider illegally discouraging a union from forming....”
(8:25 PM) Robert Seidl: And you don’t even want to entertain the idea. You simply want to make your business profitable and successful. 
(8:27 PM) Robert Seidl: It’s ok to let employees know your opinions on unions. There’s other variables of course but generally speaking you just have to remember they have a right to organize and you’re not going to “threaten” them or act against them as a result of any collective bargaining or organization.
(8:28 PM) Robert Seidl: You’re simply a business owner doing what’s best for your business, with zero consideration as to whether any individual is pro or anti union.
(8:29 PM) Robert Seidl: ^the above are good first baby steps.
(8:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya and by now hopefully I don’t have to give you the disclaimer: I am not an attorney and this is not an attorney client relationship. I am a student in law school and only speaking casually and generally hypothetically. Nothing I give should be taken as legal advice. Yadda yadda..
(8:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol
(8:32 PM) Robert Seidl: ..baby steps for how to approach it. 
(8:33 PM) Robert Seidl: *don’t discourage your employees right to organize, and don’t adversely act against any employees as because of their union participation. 
(8:35 PM) Robert Seidl: From there, there’s many things you can do to show them you’re opinion on whether or not a union could be positive or namely negative for your company.
(8:36 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh and this likely wouldn’t apply to anything you might do while in Estonia. Who the fuck knows what their laws are on such matters 😂
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼￼10 degrees and snow!!!!
(8:43 PM) Robert Seidl: Haha 
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hi omg sorry just got wifi again 
(8:43 PM) Robert Seidl: Social media hated the performance, I actually thought Adam Levine killed it
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: looks like old messages were trying to send 
(8:44 PM) Robert Seidl: People can hate (and I empathize with some of it lol), but that mofo has had hit after hit for a long time.
(8:45 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh
(8:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I haven’t read any of your other messages, but I haven’t seen the performance 
(8:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he was always my favorite judge on the voice 
(8:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: gotta take care of some emails give me 10
(8:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: do you really need to say that to me!
(8:54 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol you’re fine! I’m headed back to class!
