(10:43 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha k if you say so 😂
(10:46 PM) Robert Seidl: I did have to put my hand on it... but once I got it to a certain point I took about a minute or two to just try and focus on imagining fucking you to make myself cum without touching it... that’s definitely a first (outside of dreams). 
(10:47 PM) Robert Seidl: I honestly don’t think I would’ve been able to do it if I didn’t always do those PC muscle exercises lol
(10:47 PM) Robert Seidl: Hope you’re studying is going awesome hottie 😜
(10:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha i’m extremely impressed you were able to do it i know i wouldn’t be able to 
(10:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol it’s finally doneeeee i taught all my notes to chubby earlier then got dinner and ninenke quizzes me on everything 
(10:54 PM) Robert Seidl: I bet you would be able to with practice 😜
(10:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so i’m just going to review tomorrow morning one last time before it and i’m done!!
(10:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(11:04 PM) Robert Seidl: The thought of you sitting around in class getting horny makes me incredibly horny 
(11:04 PM) Robert Seidl: Had ANOTHER wet dream last night btw...
(11:05 PM) Robert Seidl: Shits getting out of control 
(11:05 PM) Robert Seidl: 😂
(11:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahah I had one too
(11:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but mine was in my research lab
(11:07 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha ya?!
(11:09 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yuhhh what about you
(11:10 PM) Robert Seidl: I remember last nights... we were in that city museum 😂
(11:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the demonic one??? 😂😂😂
(11:12 PM) Robert Seidl: It wasn’t in that area of it!
(11:12 PM) Robert Seidl: It was in the cave area 😂
(11:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh ahahaha 
(11:15 PM) Robert Seidl: You were grabbing my dick in the bar and we were both extremely horny looking at each other extremely lustfully and the bartender.. she was like I think you guys need to go find a place alone in here, and you go, “good idea.” — and then it was as if we were teleported immediately to this little cave area and you were bouncing on my lap / dick 😂
(11:18 PM) Robert Seidl: And you were turning around and looking at me (while your body was still facing away) holding my face and you were saying “yes, yes, oh Robby, please, yes” (amongst other things I think but that’s all I remember 😂), and the look on your face was squinty eyed / in shock / in ecstasy 😂😂😂😂
(11:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we should make it happen 
(11:23 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol I told you about the one dream I had where I was fucking you in class while other people were there right....
(11:24 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: noooooo
(11:26 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes and no one was looking at us they were just carrying on like it was completely natural
(11:26 PM) Robert Seidl: Like “oh ya Robby and Shefali are having sex again, as usual” 😂😂😂
(11:30 PM) Robert Seidl: (this next part to it I can’t remember for sure if it actually happened  in the dream or if I was just interpreting it this way) but eventually a couple girls started getting up and leaving the room and in my head I apparently somehow knew that they were leaving to masturbate (you know how sometimes you can apparently read other peoples minds in a dream) 😂😂😂
(11:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Wait do you have a link to what the thing was that was going on in that thing of the dogs? 
(11:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh lol maybe I can just go to your FB
(11:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahah just sent it to you 
(11:36 PM) Robert Seidl: Not to jump back and forth so much between dogs and sex.. 😂 ..but I guess they were going to masturbate because they had gotten too hot and bothered from us doing our thing lol
(11:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: who? 
(11:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: classmates?
(11:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes... but they were no classmates I recognized 😂😂😂

(12:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Many of the girls who listen to that especially in the extreme.... 10 years later.... 😢😥 “where have all the guys of quality that used to want me gone?” 😭😭😭
(12:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol if I saw this before I met you my only thought to my self would have been “people are stupid” and disregarded it 
(12:12 AM) Robert Seidl: “Well Susie you rode the cock carousel around the world, and the whole time while trying to learn how to love yourself... you actually learned to only love YOURSELF. —-Sooo, ya no thanks.. I’ll just go over here and have family with this  sweetheart who actually  wants to have a family.”
(12:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohh also how’s the whole tornado deal going 
(12:13 AM) Robert Seidl: It passed through completely by around 9pm!
(12:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 👍👍👍
(12:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol it was just weird it being that close to the river and the city.... because usually it’s in the middle of the really flat plains of Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas etc. 
(12:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Buttt yes traveling is great obvi!
(12:19 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s the supplanting of any willingness to sacrifice oneself for another / their family at all due to the sole aim to  “worship thyself” that will leave many in our generations very  unhappy. 
(12:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Balance peeps we need some balance 
(12:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow “obvi”

(12:28 AM) Robert Seidl: *and to clarify by that I mean from Instagram things like that or pop culture or mainstream things you mention to me —- not the way you are!!!
(12:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: tantric sex just sounds like teasing through a pilates class with a dash of meditation
