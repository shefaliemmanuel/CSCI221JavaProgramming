(2:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: how’s studying going 
(2:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol I always figured it’s not bad to have just in case! 
(2:26 AM) Robert Seidl: And ya definitely not a good thing to take regularly like I’m sure some do 
(2:27 AM) Robert Seidl: I try to take it no more than twice a month 
(2:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh come on you could do more like once a week
(2:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh my fucking god can you imagine how much of a hormonal mess I’d be??! 
(2:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha 😂
(2:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I will not keep plan B just in case.... ever lol
(2:29 AM) Robert Seidl: I support that sentiment 
(2:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m pretty sure its like a month of birth control in that pill right??
(2:29 AM) Robert Seidl: Umm not sure 🤔 
(2:30 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ve heard a lot of different things about it
(2:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: who knows 
(2:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: a funk 
(2:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: gyno*
(2:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Some people think it’s great, some hate it 
(2:31 AM) Robert Seidl: All I know is something that triggers all those hormonal changes couldn’t be good to take regularly 
(2:32 AM) Robert Seidl: Why I was so against you doing the pill if it made you feel bad at all. 
(2:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wanna see a preview of some 🎁
(2:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha sure

(2:36 AM) Robert Seidl: As long as its not fucking French 
(2:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHA
(2:38 AM) Robert Seidl: One of your surprises is ready
(2:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh wow
(2:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Proud of myself for not spoiling it 
(2:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Last night 
(2:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: well i’m happy for you 
(2:39 AM) Robert Seidl: No you’re not 
(2:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i promise I am 
(2:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m even smiling rn 
(2:40 AM) Robert Seidl: ^ that’s just cuz you’re goofy 
(2:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i can’t really argue with that
(2:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like at all hahaha
(2:42 AM) Robert Seidl: I bet I look quite  ridiculous sometimes when I’m texting / talking to you on the phone...
(2:42 AM) Robert Seidl: Just straight cheesing the whole time
(2:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you guessed it 
(2:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: possibly even borderline scary 
(2:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s like the nutcracker dress rehearsals all over again 
(2:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: where we had to smile for 4 hours straight
(2:44 AM) Robert Seidl: You bring up nutcracker and my smile immediately went away 
(2:44 AM) Robert Seidl: Bringing back PTSD
(2:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: thanks for informing me 
(2:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😈
(2:46 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m just being dramatic though, I’d still like to hear your dance and yes even your nutcracker stories. Maybe just refer to them as dance stories even when it’s about the nutcracker and I should be good.
(2:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Unfortunately I don’t censor myself
(2:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha I swear when I hear some of those songs in it I cringe and am instantly transported to sitting there at Rachael’s nutcracker for like 10 years straight 
(2:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sorry not sorry hahahaha 
(2:48 AM) Robert Seidl: Why not? Google, Apple, and Twitter have already begun censoring the fuck out of anyone they want to why can’t you missy?
(2:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: because i’m not a computer but a mere human 
(2:49 AM) Robert Seidl: Shush 
(2:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but if it REALLLYYY bothers you that much (if you were being serious) I suppose I can try 
(2:49 AM) Robert Seidl: You have plenty of computer in you 
(2:49 AM) Robert Seidl: ^ I bet you loved that comment..
(2:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Nahh for the record it’s just kind of a way to make fun of myself because I was such a wussy at being able to sit through those. 
(2:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Tchaikovsky’s is an essential part of holiday music 😢
(2:51 AM) Robert Seidl: There’s a coupleee if the songs that are still ok

(3:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Knew it was a short matter of time before you figure out how to overcome it 
(3:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha

(3:44 AM) Robert Seidl: Ik right 
(3:45 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha when he was waking you up at 4 in the morning to play for the 40th time you could..
(3:46 AM) Robert Seidl: But itd be close..
(3:46 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya it’s actually one of the top mixes I’d consider if I was going to get one 
(3:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’d probably end up sleep walking to play with him hahaha
(3:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: a great choice 
(3:48 AM) Robert Seidl: You sleep walk?!
(3:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no lol
(3:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but if I was being woken up for the 40th time I would 
(3:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: nothing should ever stop you from getting what you want 
(3:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: especially a dog lol
(3:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes it should lol 
(3:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha don’t you try to persuade me my resolve is already shaky on that and you know it!!
(3:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m well aware hahaha
(3:51 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ve accepted that I have to get my fixes through friends and the family  dogs 
(3:52 AM) Robert Seidl: How would you feel if I got a dog when you left for Estonia?
(3:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I would barley be able to wait to play with him/her when I get back 
(3:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and would need constant video/ picture updates 
(3:53 AM) Robert Seidl: Imagine seeing it grow through its puppy stages and stuff though.... and not being able to be there for it at all....
(3:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: leave me alone
(3:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you don’t need to rub it in
(3:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: im trying to stay positive about this hypothetical 
(3:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Eventually every picture of it being cute as hell as a puppy would rub it in 
(3:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i could deal
(3:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’d have no other option 
(3:56 AM) Robert Seidl: If you say so. We’ll see if you can...
(3:56 AM) Robert Seidl: Jk jk 
(3:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ROBBY
(3:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it would be a really good way to torture me
(3:57 AM) Robert Seidl: That’d just be cruel
(3:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh shut up
(3:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you would totally do it
(3:58 AM) Robert Seidl: No I wouldn’t do it to spite you, plus I wouldn’t like the idea of you not getting to see it at all as a puppy 
(3:59 AM) Robert Seidl: If I did it it would only be because I felt it was the right time. But it’s not, so I need to stop talking about it and get it the fuck together 😂
(3:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ve found an easy solution
(4:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: get the puppy tomorrow
(4:00 AM) Robert Seidl: 😳
(4:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Stop 
(4:00 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m trying so hard.. to fight.. this off...
(4:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(4:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: why are you trying to flight it off??? 
(4:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you love dogs
(4:07 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m far too busy and will likely have to travel... and it just changes things. You have to plan everything around the dog it depends on you. Plus I’d want to have the time to train it well, and really take care of it. To do that it’d likely be far more feasible with someone else able to help. 
(4:08 AM) Robert Seidl: Wouldn’t want to leave it cooped up alone in an apartment for long periods of time without someone either..
(4:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is just sad now 
(4:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Haha 
(4:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Ik right 
(4:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Wait what is?
(4:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 1. you being to busy to have a dog 
2. i just pictured a dog sitting in your apartment alone 
(4:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: being bored 
(4:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and sad 
(4:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and it made me sad
(4:11 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya that would be... it’s not right.
(4:12 AM) Robert Seidl: So many people impulsively get dogs (lol and they’re not even thatttt crazy about dogs in the first place) and they have absolutely no business doing so. 
(4:13 AM) Robert Seidl: And most people are shitty as hell dog parents (and end up making shitty parents too lol). 
(4:13 AM) Robert Seidl: I like trying to doing things right..
(4:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol imagine how much self control it’s taken for me not to cave for the past several years and get one with how much I love them?
(4:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Do* not “doing”
(4:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ve met multiple owners who are just bored so they get a dog....
(4:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lots and lots of self control 
(4:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you can look forward to having a million doggie later on in life 
(4:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: at least you can look forward to having millions of doggos later on in life*
(4:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Exactly!!!
(4:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Will probably have a kennel license (most states you have to have one to own more than a couple dogs lol)
(4:25 AM) Robert Seidl: My family almost applied for one 😂
(4:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh hahaha 
(4:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: can I be the #1 dog sitter when you can’t hang with them hahaha
(4:41 AM) Robert Seidl: Absolutely 
(8:37 PM) e:: did you ever end up getting the laws of human nature by robert greene 
(10:00 PM) Robert Seidl: I didn’t not yet but it’s on my list!
(10:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: feel free to cross it off your list now! 
(12:05 AM) Robert Seidl: Shefali! You didn’t have to do that! 
(1:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I know lol
(10:13 PM) Robert Seidl: Your flight departs at 530am Wednesday, what time does it land  in STL?
(10:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 9am
(10:23 PM) Robert Seidl: Awesome. Haha on my calendar to be at the airport at that time 😜
(10:24 PM) Robert Seidl: Still can’t believe I abandoned you there last time... and then immediately had family bombard you while you were exhausted..
(10:25 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t worry about it I could have run off that adrenaline for another 15 hours 
(10:26 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha see you then... or a couple hours later 😉
(10:27 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol no, you will see me at 9 or whenever your plain lands..
(10:28 PM) Robert Seidl: You had adrenaline going that day? 
(10:28 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I barely slept the night before something had to keep me up for connecting flights
(10:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also might have been a little excited to see you 
(10:31 PM) Robert Seidl: I guess you could say I’m a little excited to see you right now.

(10:38 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha
(10:38 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya no chance. 
(10:39 PM) Robert Seidl: Who am I kidding (you technically I guess)... I’m fucking thrilled to see you and have missed you like crazy 
(10:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol I can’t wait to see youuuuu and hang out with ya (after your last exam of course) 
(10:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s been a shorter amount of time in comparison to our last visit but I feel like i’ve missed you more this time around 
(11:17 PM) Robert Seidl: That’s a positive 😉
(5:56 AM) Robert Seidl: Holy Toledo 36 hours until you’re here kiddo 
(5:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: someone’s counting down hahaha 
(5:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Pfff nooo...
(5:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i haven’t packed or cleaned my apartment or anything.....
(5:58 AM) Robert Seidl: Just a tiny Robby ok amount of easy math...
(5:59 AM) Robert Seidl: Are you going to move out when you get back?
(5:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I like this Robby doing math thing you got going on here
(6:00 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s about the extent you’ll get out of me though bahaha 
(6:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah since i’ll have a couple friends staying over before christmas 
(6:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sometimes a little bit is just enough 
(6:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Well, they’re your friends so they’ll totally understand if you basically just shove everything in your closet 😜
(6:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha I meant taking everything homeee 
(6:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: how many exams do you have tomorrow??
(6:12 AM) Robert Seidl: 1 more exam to do but it’s take home and a bit of a group project to finish up
(6:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’re sooooo close to being done 
(6:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Almost wish that I told you you could come today and then we’d just go to the library together! That would’ve been two more nights together! (One of my finals I thought I’d have to take in class tomorrow I was able to get moved up to last week at the last minute)
(6:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Would’ve been soo worth it and I know you would’ve allowed me to focus on it as I did it!!
(6:27 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m telling ya I think I’m going to have to find a way to pick a several dozen mile chunk of Estonia up and place it in St. Louis. 
(6:28 AM) Robert Seidl: You and all of your classmates won’t notice the difference...
(6:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: well i’m glad you picked Wednesday just to be on the safe side!!
(6:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: obviously school first 
(6:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha
(6:29 AM) Robert Seidl: I know you would’ve been on my team with placing school first even if you were here.
(6:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I really hope you can pick up a piece of Estonia and place it close to ya
(6:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s just 2 more days of build up in my head lol
(6:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Ok I’ll do what I can. I’ll call Elon he can make it happen.
(6:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Nope fuck that I’d take the extra two nights with you 
(6:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: come on i’m trying to take a positive turn on it hahaha
