(3:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Holy cuteness 
(3:25 AM) Robert Seidl: That has to be a German Shepherd lab mix 
(3:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(3:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not a big cat person but wow 
(3:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Looks like an Asian cat 
(3:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just because it’s sleeping and it’s eyes are closed?.....
(3:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha never said anything about the eyes....
(3:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what makes it look asian???
(3:32 AM) Robert Seidl: Ok ya the eyes 
(3:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha 
(3:43 AM) Robert Seidl: That puppy thoughhhhhh
(3:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Was it a Shepherd lab mix
(3:43 AM) Robert Seidl: ?
(3:45 AM) Robert Seidl: I already sent it to my sister labeling it German Shepherd lab mix because I’ve been trying desperately to get any member of my family to get one 
(3:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahhahaha she didn’t know 
(3:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she was holding him for her friend 
(3:47 AM) Robert Seidl: The floppy ears 
(3:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: cutest thing ever
(3:47 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m so glad you stopped 
(3:48 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha you basically play Pokémon go but with dogs 
(3:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol I can’t walk by one and NOT take a picture 
(3:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Pokémon Dog-go: for groups of people who don’t have dogs themselves but are desperately obsessed with them to get together and catch pictures of the cutest possible dogs.
(3:50 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(3:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I can see it now- leaving the library to get some food... end up walking around for 4 hours looking for doggos around charleston 
(3:52 AM) Robert Seidl: ^this is part of why you and my sister are 2 of the 3.5 women I love in my life 
(3:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha 
(3:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: is your God Daughter the .5?
(3:53 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh shit.. 
(3:53 AM) Robert Seidl: Ok.. 
(3:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 💀💀💀
(3:53 AM) Robert Seidl: 4.5
(3:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god lol
(3:55 AM) Robert Seidl: The .5 is for a girl that I half love because half of the time I don’t like her and she can be a total bitch
(3:56 AM) Robert Seidl: She’s also really ugly 
(4:06 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s Georgie, the Losso Ops-So my family’s 3rd dog 
(4:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so if i’m understanding correctly, you ½ hate a dog????
(4:09 AM) Robert Seidl: No, but he mean-ness to others brings my love down to a a .5. That’s still a big deal.
(4:10 AM) Robert Seidl: For whatever reason she really likes me so I’m forced to love her. 
(4:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she prob likes you because you don’t like her
(4:11 AM) Robert Seidl: Probably 
(4:11 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s frequently what happens with any females when I really don’t like them 
(4:11 AM) Robert Seidl: But humans don’t get the dog effect so it doesn’t make me love them 
(4:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and she’s “ugly”??
(4:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’re horrible 
(4:12 AM) Robert Seidl: I know 
(4:12 AM) Robert Seidl: But she is 
(4:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: good 
(4:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha 
(4:13 AM) Robert Seidl: I told you the story behind how they got her right?
(4:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Georgie is proof that I can love any dog 
(4:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ½ love*
(4:15 AM) Robert Seidl: We often just call her George, sometimes her female name just doesn’t seem appropriate 
(4:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what’s the story
(4:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Rachael and my mom randomly came home with her and us guys were PISSED
(4:16 AM) Robert Seidl: We wanted to be a part of picking the third dog, and we certainly wouldn’t have picked Georgie 
(4:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: power move
(4:20 AM) Robert Seidl: Rachael was really little and was with mom somewhere, and they decided it’d be a genius idea to see a litter of puppies. Rachael was convinced she had a connection with Georgie and Georgie was special, and cried and everything. So my mom decides ok we’ll take her home and maybe we’ll get her (as if that was going to be an option for any of the men to tell a little girl who felt she bonded with it even more that it had to go). They knew what they were doing. 
(4:21 AM) Robert Seidl: Here’s the best part: Rachael’s rational for liking Georgie... Georgie was the one of the litter that was anti-social, wouldn’t play with any of the other puppies, and ran around in circles by itself. 
(4:21 AM) Robert Seidl: She thought that was so cute. 
(4:22 AM) Robert Seidl: Basically she picked the socially dysfunctional and autistic one of the litter  
(4:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i love this story so far
(4:22 AM) Robert Seidl: And autistic she was....
(4:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Turns out she was an absolute fucking terror...
(4:25 AM) Robert Seidl: She’d brutally attack poor Frankie and Sammy (which I still haven’t forgiven her for how she treated them Bahahaha), never listen, never come when called, snap at people, and refused to ever go to the bathroom anywhere but in the house. Would literally hold it even when outside until she got inside. 
(4:26 AM) Robert Seidl: As the men were on the verge of trading her in numerous times, we were always confronted by the power of Rachael in tears promising shed train Georgie. 
(4:27 AM) Robert Seidl: To this day, Georgie is not fully trained, and is still quite a bitch. 
(4:27 AM) Robert Seidl: The worst part of this entire story is... 
(4:27 AM) Robert Seidl: She’s kind of grown on me. 
(4:27 AM) Robert Seidl: I begrudgingly love her.
(4:28 AM) Robert Seidl: And part of the way I love her is by thinking of new ways to make fun of her.
(4:29 AM) Robert Seidl: I threaten we should get rid of her all of the time... but in truth I wouldn’t actually let anyone get rid of her.
(4:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: awhhhhh
(4:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: frankie and sammy are dogs??
(4:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh my fucking god you would’ve loveddddd them. 
(4:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Giant golden-doodles who couldn’t see, ran into things, were extremely needy and affectionate, and thought they were still lap dogs.
(4:32 AM) Robert Seidl: They passed away about a year and a half or two years ago.
(4:32 AM) Robert Seidl: Hence Ernie and Winston 
(4:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Frankie was special. The biggest most human eyes on a dog possible and would talk to you. He was not a dog, he was a person. 
(4:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: awhhhhh they sound adorable 
(4:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m so sorry 😢😢😢
(4:36 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼Sammy 
(4:36 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s all good! 
(4:36 AM) Robert Seidl: All doggos go to heaven don’t ya know 
(4:38 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼Frankie
(4:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he looks like a wise grandpa 
(4:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha ya 
(4:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I know but whenever animals die it’s pretty intense 
(4:39 AM) Robert Seidl: His hair was shorter there... but half the time he just looked funny as hell. Couldn’t even see from his hair really 
(4:40 AM) Robert Seidl: They had probably the best lives a dog could have bahaha were soooo spoiled 
(4:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Everybody was always trying to gain favor and secretly feeding them 
(4:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha 
(4:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: how all doggos should be cheated 
(4:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: treated 
(4:52 AM) Robert Seidl: What times the final tomorrow?
(4:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: noon
(4:53 AM) Robert Seidl: How’d the one go today? The pup distracted me lol
(4:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 90% of the class finished in the first hour, but 2 other kids and I took all 3 hours and are pretty sure we got a perfect score 
(4:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(4:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: thanks lol
(4:56 AM) Robert Seidl: I wish I could give you a treat
(4:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhhhh a treat??
(4:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes a bone 😂😂😂😂
(4:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: woof 
(4:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Wasn’t setting it up for that at all but it was low hanging I had to 
(4:58 AM) Robert Seidl: You have to study a bunch for the one tomorrow?
(4:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s spanish 
(4:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha 
(4:58 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh ok. Not bad probably right?
(4:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: should be cake 
(11:42 PM) Robert Seidl: Era una pieza de pastel?
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Sí, pero todos lo lograron y hubo muchas preguntas con trucos ...
(12:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes but all of the questions had a lot of tricks?? 
(12:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes but everyone flew through it and there were a lot of trick questions 
(12:13 AM) Robert Seidl: Ahhhh
(12:13 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha
(12:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Well, the wheat has to be cleaned from the chaff somehow 
(12:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol I was just thinking about you- the guy to my left had a lima shirt on the guy to my right’s back was torn up
(12:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: none of them even did the extra credit and my professor yelled 😂
(12:18 AM) Robert Seidl: You’ve never heard the expression separating the wheat from the chaff?
(12:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol it was said by a judge in one of the cases I read recently leave me alone 
(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sorry I don’t hang out with farmers??
(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHA
(12:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Lima as in the citadel?
(12:37 AM) Robert Seidl: And I guy had a torn up back and that reminded you of me? Lol
(12:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes and well that was phrased incorrectly- it reminded me of when you had a scratch on your back 
(12:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol 
(12:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: anywho 
(12:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Was my scratch from lifting? Or from you?
(12:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: me
(12:53 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya hahaha 
(12:55 AM) Robert Seidl: You were concerned you scratched me, I thought it was great that you scratched me lol
(12:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it looked like it hurt 
(12:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i felt bad
(12:56 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol no. I wouldn’t have known it was there unless you said something.
(12:56 AM) Robert Seidl: My hands can’t even touch 90% of my back
(12:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we gotta work on that
(12:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: needless to say I was very distracted in yoga this afternoon
(12:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya
(12:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Tell me more 
(12:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you should join 
(12:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we could make some pretty cool shapes 
(1:01 AM) Robert Seidl: I actually think I’d be pretty good at some of those partner yoga things, especially at any exercises that required core and shoulders 
(1:02 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s the flexibility I’d struggle terribly with 
(1:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Maybe somedayyyy with you I will 
(1:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: please don’t hurt your self 
(1:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah I think you would be a natural at that stuff 
(1:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Had a dream about you last night kiddo
(1:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohh tell me more 
(1:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also I almost subconsciously clicked on dogs on netflix 
(1:23 AM) Robert Seidl: It was several separate dreams it seemed, and you were with me in every single one lol 
(1:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: humm themes of these dreams??
(1:24 AM) Robert Seidl: No idea. I tried hard to remember the details when I woke up.
(1:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what a shame 
(1:26 AM) Robert Seidl: You know how sometimes you can’t remember the details to a dream but you remember the feelings? 
(1:26 AM) Robert Seidl: They were quite happy dreams that’s all I know  lol 
(1:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: all the time 
(1:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: well nice lol
(1:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Literally all I remember is we were having a really good time.
(1:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: awh I have a serious question for ya
(1:46 AM) Robert Seidl: Then all I can promise is I’ll do my best to put a serious expression on my face and not answer with a cheesy joke...
(1:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i just wanted to know what to get for dinner but I already ordered it 
(1:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha
(1:48 AM) Robert Seidl: You should order Targarian 
(1:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t believe that’s a word 
(1:49 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s a word, but you’re on the right track it is a fictitious word. 
(1:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(1:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha ya I expected you to google it (but just hopefully to know that it wasn’t a real place even before you googled it)
(1:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it sounds pretty fake lol
(1:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha you didn’t know for sure!!!!!
(1:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: there’s lots of things I don’t know 
(1:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: always double checking hahaha
(1:53 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂😂 it’s too bad we aren’t at a hotel in the old days or something and you had to call down to the front desk or ask the concierge what Targaryen place they recommend for takeout bahaha 
(1:55 AM) Robert Seidl: You’d probably try soo hard to find one if I said that’s what I wanted to eat 😂
(1:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Which I would feel bad about after that effort and confusion. 
(1:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh m god I wouldn’t stop till I found a place 
(1:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that would be a cruel joke 
(1:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: even if the people at the hotel were like that’s fake i’d probably be like oh okay and ask someone else 
(1:59 AM) Robert Seidl: As a way of saying sorry at some point in the future I’d order Chinese food or something for you but request that they label everything “Authentic Targaryen Cuisine”... or I’d do pick up and label it all that myself. 
(2:01 AM) Robert Seidl: And then I would sheepishly act as if I had no idea how it got there and that Targaryen food existed after all  
(2:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes it would be a somewhat cruel joke but so funny and worth it 😂😂😂
(2:04 AM) Robert Seidl: But I’d make it up to ya tenfold 😜
(2:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that would make it 10000000x worse because then I would feel like I failed and couldn’t find any....
(2:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: would be mad funny tho 
(2:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: haha aq

(9:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: https://youtu.be/XuI6GTY9eVc
(5:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: good morning babe 
hope you accomplish everything you wanted for today!!
(6:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: how valuable are co-ops if you already have a couple of internships 
(10:41 PM) Robert Seidl: Thanks! You too!
(10:42 PM) Robert Seidl: 1) I’ve seen terms like co-op be defined quite differently by different people / companies / schools 
(10:44 PM) Robert Seidl: 2) most general I’ve seen it defined as school with alternated work periods, or a multi work / school period with an employer. Often times the employer agrees to a plan and even funds you academically
(10:45 PM) Robert Seidl: Sometimes that’s with the expectation or agreement that you are going to continue working with that company. 
(10:47 PM) Robert Seidl: The PMBA program at WashU is an example of a co-op, where the employer pays for their employees to go to WashU during the course of their employment 
(10:48 PM) Robert Seidl: Since a loose term like co-op can mean so many different things and be structured many different ways... obviously the way it’d be valued by a particular future employer can vary greatly. 
(10:49 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha in other words it depends.
(10:53 PM) Robert Seidl: In general employers aren’t going to mind as much how you structured your work experience as much as they’ll value your commitment, insight gained, and value of said work experience. In general you just want to be able to show employers that you were involved + competent academically and extracurricularly, and put yourself into  valuable work experiences. 
(10:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼so basically is this worth it 
(10:56 PM) Robert Seidl: There’s many ways to go about it. A lot of people let their thinking become very rigid with the way they go about this stuff.. but there’s many different ways of structuring your work experiences and academics which can good for your palatability for employers.  
(10:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: is my question or should i focus on my research instead 
(10:59 PM) Robert Seidl: The most accurate answer to your question depends on your preferences and the employer or type of employer your seeking out when you graduate. 
(11:00 PM) Robert Seidl: It might be something worth looking into, Bosch is a reputable company, but that was a pretty vague email haha
(11:02 PM) Robert Seidl: Also, in general extensive research can be really good for students who are pursuing more immediate graduate type programs and / or pursuing a more academic employment (can also be useful for other things but those are the most common I’d say). 
(11:10 PM) Robert Seidl: ^specifically to the text that starts “the most accurate answer...” - what you will give you the best understanding of how you want to structure any combination of academic / work experience will be: ***ask all of the  employers your interested in what how they value the different combinations (like research, internships, co-ops etc.). The other thing you should do is look into the details of that program they offered you (what are the requirements, how would they match up with your life balance, what is the work itself like, how much would you learn, what is the programs reputation etc.?)

After fully investigating the job, talking to mentors, gathering info on your desired future employers: then you weigh it all together. ***You will know the best combination for you and your career if you do the proper information gathering from all of those sources!***
(11:13 PM) Robert Seidl: Also, it looks like the Bosch thing might interfere with Estonia??
(11:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so in the path whenever i’ve gotten internships and what not the ones who just reached out to me and were like okay you’re cool join us for a couple months we’re alright but I kinda like working to get that opportunity 

when I randomly met the bosh recruiting she started grilling me about my resume and then said “anyone who is good enough for Apple is good enough for us”...... I wasn’t really tooooo big of a fan of that

she said they would work out whatever semesters work the best for me 

I know the bare minimum to get by for computer engineering, however I know a fuck ton for computer science 

all my past internships and what not have been purely in computer science so it’s different in that way and the program has a great reputation (not to be annoying, but a lot of students try to get into it) 

the nice think about Bosh (when I compare is to the other big 2, Blackbaud and Boeing) is that it’s not an original American company so they don’t run it like it is 

if I wanted to start working at another plant it would be quite easy to transfer, but I’m not sure if it’s that was with most tech sections of companies 
(11:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also under no circumstances do I want to stay in charleston upon graduation 
(11:25 PM) Robert Seidl: See, I knew you were already doing a great job of investigating and weighing the variables 😁😁😁
(11:28 PM) Robert Seidl: Good rule of thumb: never stop investigating / information gathering and never stop asking yourself what is best for what you want. If you’re always doing those two things you will naturally find optimal career paths. 
(11:32 PM) Robert Seidl: By the way have a potential connection at Bosch in Germany if you ever needed it. Someone I know in Charleston S.C. actually that has a son pretty high up at Bosch in Germany. 
(11:34 PM) Robert Seidl: Gods honest truth all of my romantic feelings for you aside: I would be 100% confident in recommending you to anyone for anything purely based off of your merit. 
(12:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: for the first time in my life I am not 100% sure on what exactly I want after college
(12:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I do not enjoy this feeling, but at least I have different paths planned that I can take
(12:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I am very flattered that you would potentially offer connecting me with someone from Bosh in Germany
(12:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I am just not comfortable with using connections like those at this point! Its kind of silly since everyone is always like “use all your connections all the time.” I like the idea of getting something simply because of my efforts, ya know
(12:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t get me wrong I SUPERRRR appreciate you even mentioning it ☺️
