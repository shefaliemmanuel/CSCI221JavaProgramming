(12:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and un trip is secured 
(1:32 AM) Robert Seidl: Whatttt?! How’d you pull that off?!! 

And awesome I’m pumped up for you you’re going to kill it! When’s the date for it?
(3:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hurricane!!!

it’s sometime from September 24-28 but my mentor is a keynote speaker on the 24/25 so he wants me to be there for both those days
(3:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think what sealed the deal was that I came up in a board meeting to  be the keynote student speaker at Impact Day next year 
(3:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: little do they know i’ll be in estonia 
(3:53 AM) Robert Seidl: That definitely couldn’t have hurt 😉
(3:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Look at you just racking up merit 😜
(3:59 AM) Robert Seidl: Can’t say I’m the least bit surprised. We’ll have to celebrate you being awesome whenever I see you (in addition to celebrating your birthday 😂)
(4:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if we can’t make it to UN week because of the hurricane then we will go in the next couple of weeks after it 
(4:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I honestly don’t mention these things to seem that way... i’m sorry 
(4:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I just get excited 
(4:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and talk too much 
(4:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂 in addition to celebrating you being alive with your insane schedule 
(4:49 AM) Robert Seidl: I can tell the place it’s coming from Shefali. I love you sharing your excitement with me (if you could see me I literally get visibly excited myself for you).
(4:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: haha good 
(4:51 AM) Robert Seidl: There’s no such thing as you talking too much.
(4:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol it’d take a hell of a lot more than that to kill me 😏
(4:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: soooo I did a nightmare of a side project earlier this year for a company and their person who is supusto pay me is emailing me and asked me a bunch of questions and now this
