(3:44 PM) Robert Seidl: Is this because he has a pair of ugg boots that accent his butt?
(3:48 PM) Robert Seidl: And does this mean I shouldn’t pack my ugg boots? Will it be too hot temperature / beauty wise for them in Charleston? 
(3:49 PM) Robert Seidl: (Can’t do anything about my big butt that’s just the way baby Jesus made me)
(3:52 PM) Robert Seidl: ....ooh maybe I found my Halloween costume....
(3:56 PM) Robert Seidl: I’ll just wear ugg boots, the rest of my body nude to make sure my behind is displayed, a pair of basic white girl sunglasses, a super basic purse (and / or other basic white girl accessory options) and I’ll have a mocha Frappuccino in my hand... 
(4:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol no it just means he looks basic
(4:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: its hoodie season in charleston bring all your uggs
(4:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg hahahahahaha
(4:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: just don’t get arrested on halloween
(4:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think if you added a pink sparkly scarf that would complete your costume
(4:51 PM) Robert Seidl: ^thats too average Friday night
(4:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: halloween is next wednesday
(4:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also what wouldn’t be average? going completely naked?
(4:55 PM) Robert Seidl: I was directing that toward the pink scarf
(4:57 PM) Robert Seidl: Come on now... I’m a classy lady 😝
(5:03 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh ahahaha my mistake
(5:03 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: a blue scarf might be more your style
(5:06 PM) Robert Seidl: The classy lady part referred to the absence of regularity of public nudity 
(5:07 PM) Robert Seidl: Pink would do just fine 
(5:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yikes im just missing everything
