(12:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: nah thats these students time to have his undivided attention
(1:00 AM) Robert Seidl: I love how you think about all of these nuances 
(1:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I felt like an empty nester for a hot second there since i’m not teaching my freshman class anymore...
I can’t imagine how our professors feel when we leave the incubator 
(1:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sorry for the long texts I drank coffee for the first time in 2 weeks and feel like i’m on adderall
(1:09 AM) Robert Seidl: I fucking love your long texts 
(1:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sooo my advance algorithms class has an extra credit opportunity he spoke to us about 2 months ago
(1:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: obv I signed up, right?? 
(1:11 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d hope so!!
(1:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s an national programming competition that lasts 5 hours 
(1:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but he never told us the date till now 
(1:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s Nov 3...
(1:13 AM) Robert Seidl: So... do it! I support you 100%^100 (that was supposed to be to the hundredth power)
(1:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m sooo sorry 
(1:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m either going to be sick once I get there or ask him if there’s anything else I can do since I’ll be out of town. 
(1:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Don’t be silly!!!
(1:15 AM) Robert Seidl: I wouldn’t be bothered by it at all! 
(1:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Like when I say I support you 100%^100 I mean it.....
(1:23 AM) Robert Seidl: The only way I’d be ok with you missing it was if you were 100% certain that he was going to let you do something else for just as much credit... but it’s no big deal at all otherwise! 
(2:41 AM) e:: lol the team I was deciding between invited me to dinner 
(2:41 AM) e:: also I super appreciate it
(2:41 AM) e:: but I don’t want to go 
(2:41 AM) e:: if you’ll be here 
(2:41 AM) e:: THERE IS SO MUCH TEAAAS
(3:37 AM) Robert Seidl: You mean teams?
(3:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no I mean tea
(3:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol oh 
(3:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: do you remember what it means hahha
(3:42 AM) Robert Seidl: You mean like gossip? 
(3:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Also it’d be totally fine!! I’d even go with you to it (wouldn’t want to intrude though so would be just as fine with looking forward to seeing you when you were done with it)
(3:51 AM) Robert Seidl: I actually have never been to a hackathon hahaha 
(4:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so apparently the main guy on Terrabase blew up on Dr.Wyman
(4:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like so bad that the other 2 gurls has to write a handwritten note saying how sorry they were....
(4:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg you’d want to come??
(4:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: (not really a hackathon but A for effort 😘)
(4:02 AM) Robert Seidl: ^ok we’ll have to come back to that at the top  so you can further explain—- 
(4:03 AM) Robert Seidl: But yes of course, if it was a coding type gig / hackathon type thing open to anyone then I would actually love seeing that with you 
(4:07 AM) Robert Seidl: I wouldn’t want to intrude though if it wasn’t really something you were supposed to have other people with you at
(4:09 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m game with you though 
(4:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: since all of us didn’t know it was over fall break and all the teams are falling apart 😢
(4:13 AM) Robert Seidl: Wait the extra credit or the mentor team thing?
(4:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Extra Credit 
(4:13 AM) Robert Seidl: Gotcha gotcha you had teams for it...
(4:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: apparently he said there was another option for extra credit at the meet up today for those “out of town” but we can still go check it out if you wanna see what it’s like!!
(4:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg you wouldn’t be intruding 
(4:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: people would prob just stare at U
(4:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: since you don’t look like CS hahahahhahaha 
(4:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Shefali, I’m 100% down with you 
(4:15 AM) Robert Seidl: (He’ll honestly I’d  totally see myself going to check something like that out alone out of curiosity) 
(4:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Hell*
(4:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahah amazing 
(4:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg wait you can totally learn how to program there
(4:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha 
(4:18 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m willing to give it a shot
(4:18 AM) Robert Seidl: (Also cool with casually observing too lol)
(4:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: an event hosted by a College or University that has 3 tracks/ topics 

Major League Hacking brings in professionals from these tracks to speak to hackers interested in creating a solution for one of these tracks 

An event at which tech companies look to recruit new talent (while giving out lots of free shirts and pillows...)

this event lasts a weekend and at the end you present your companies/ products for cash or tech prizes
(4:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: an event that is held twice a year nationally 

4 Major Conferences: 
North East
North West
South East (CofC typically always places or wins)
South West

a series of insane mathematical word problems that require a programming solution generated by a team of 3 in typically 5 hours 
(4:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: goal is to answer as many questions as possible completely correctly (no partial credit) 
(4:25 AM) Robert Seidl: If it’s something you want to do, I say let’s do it 😉
(4:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Thanks for the education! I’m learning! Albeit slowly hahaha
(4:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg stop you’re doing amazing 
(4:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just by even being open to lead about this stuff 
(4:28 AM) Robert Seidl: I appreciate your confidence in me... but I’m afraid I’ve got a bit to go before I’m open to being a leader in the coding world 😂😂😂😂
(4:28 AM) Robert Seidl: (I know it was a typo - just felt like running with it)
(4:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha you’re going to do great!!
(4:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you get elementary math
(4:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’ll be fine
(4:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh also guess what
(4:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Ummmm 
(4:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Debatable......
(4:33 AM) Robert Seidl: 8x8 = 68 right?
(4:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh yeah 😒🙃
(4:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(4:37 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahahaha I’d run for the fucking hills if a Kardashian girl (or any girl of kardashian nature for that matter) told me that 😂😂😂😂 
(4:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahahahahahahahaha
(4:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so apparently the guy on the Terrabase yelled at Dr. Wyman, during their team meeting
(4:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was so bad that the girls had to write a hand written apology letter….
(4:42 AM) Robert Seidl: More context please
(4:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Terrabase is the company I am mentoring…..
(4:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Wyman hates their idea
(4:42 AM) Robert Seidl: Right 
(4:42 AM) Robert Seidl: Ok
(4:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Dr. Wyman is one of the main mentors of the incubator program
(4:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s like all Dr. Starr and Dr. Wyman- if one of them doesn’t like you, you’re done for
(4:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Yup had that part 
(4:43 AM) Robert Seidl: The girls...?
(4:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the other 2 team members
(4:45 AM) Robert Seidl: Is there something wrong with the guy who yelled at Wyman?
(4:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what do you mean
(4:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no he’s just a student
(4:46 AM) Robert Seidl: Yet he yelled at a professor?
(4:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the prof said his company was bad and he got mad
(4:46 AM) Robert Seidl: Pfhhhhhhhhh
(4:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he seemed so chill
(4:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: im shook
(4:46 AM) Robert Seidl: Typical millennials 
(4:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Can’t take any criticism 
(4:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: YOU ARE A MILLENNIAL
(4:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: thats like rule num 1
(4:47 AM) Robert Seidl: (You’re right and he probably barely is lol)
(4:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if someone doesn’t like your idea you say ok and thank you for your input
(4:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and move on
(4:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hes older than me
(4:48 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s not just millennials just people are fucking soft and weak 
(4:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it makes sense now because wyman didnt even say hi to their team when he walked in
(4:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼progress!!!
(4:50 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m not surprised at all. I’ve seen this play out probably hundreds of times now where a  person seemed “chill” before.... but pop any of the bubbles on their bubble wrap covered world they’ve had their whole life... and they lose it. 
(4:53 AM) Robert Seidl: Could be hindsight effecting coloring my opinion... but just from reading the way he wrote that message to the other professor... I don’t like him
(4:55 AM) Robert Seidl: That kid seems like a disaster waiting to happen on any project he’s ever a part of.
(4:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he wrote that message to me!
(4:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I have my work cut out for me
(4:59 AM) Robert Seidl: 1) starts off not apologizing 2) maintains a completely unapologetic theme throughout 
(5:00 AM) Robert Seidl: He has the “I’m right, the professors wrong, I’m just passionate about my baby and understand it better than anyone and if they don’t like it it’s just because they can’t see how brilliant it is” posture 
(5:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: youre not wrong, but why would he start off apologizing
(5:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he didnt do anything to me
(5:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it sounds like he couldn’t give a fuck
(5:02 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re the mentor. You took them on. He still should’ve been conciliatory.... EVEN if he was still 100% certain he was right.
(5:03 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m not close to the ground whatsoever, so obviously I won’t have nearly as good of a read.... but this kid reeks of #uncoachable from the info you’ve given me lol
(5:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I suppose, but I don’t know them well enough to expect anything like that
(5:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahahahah that just sounds like a challenge to me
(5:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Also, if a mentor / professor or someone with expertise doesn’t like your idea, they very likely are seeing weak spots you might not be... and that’s an opportunity to make your idea better, by asking “why” and digging to find out any weaknesses they might see. It doesn’t mean you can’t respectfully disagree with someone’s opinion on your idea and go on with your idea anyways (certain situations do call for that), but in this setting he should’ve been 1000x more humble and excited to learn about how he could make his product better.
(5:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I couldn’t agree more
(5:09 AM) Robert Seidl: If he truly “yelled” at a professor over his idea... then that’s a major red flag. (But who knows maybe the seriousness or intensity of the convo wasn’t actually bad or as serious as was reported and in that case it’d be possible it wasn’t that huge of a deal)
(5:10 AM) Robert Seidl: You definitely approached it nicely with how you made him feel comfortable. 
(5:11 AM) Robert Seidl: Keep doing that, make him as comfortable as you can, and he’ll reveal more of his true nature to you (whether good or bad).
(5:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Karisha, the class TA told me this…. none of this has been validated in my eyes, therefore I would not like to create my own conclusions ya know
(5:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he seems to have a soft spot for me, he said chandler talks about me a lot so I think that has made him comfortable
(5:16 AM) Robert Seidl: You need to information gather for sure. 
(5:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Also all of this is not to say he’s a bad “person”.... 
(5:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he could be fine might just need to gain a bit of situational awareness
(5:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wait so remember ImpactCents (the other UN team) they are splitting up after their incubator in charlotte
(5:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: on the DL
(5:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not like youre going to tell anyone lol
(5:21 AM) Robert Seidl: But if he yelled at a professor over his idea, he’s an entitled over reactive / over sensitive  kid who has A LOT to learn if he wants to have any chance of being successful in business. When I talk to you about these things I’m using high standards.... in other words 90% of decently intelligent people out there you’d still never want to get too close to them business wise, because they just don’t have what it takes. 
(5:25 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m shocked 
(5:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol no definitely not going to tell anyone
(5:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Maybe it was a misunderstanding
(5:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: people mess up
(5:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I’ll find out on friday
(5:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: stay tuned
(5:27 AM) Robert Seidl: The “I’m shocked” was for the impactcents breaking up
(5:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol I know
(5:27 AM) Robert Seidl: K haha just checking 
(5:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ImpactCents = Chad + Tilly
(5:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Tilly is fucking one of the mentors in the incubator and some politician that just had a kid in charlotte
(5:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and obv his wife doesn’t know
(5:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: her family is basically funding the entire project like all 300K
(5:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she threw it in Chad’s face and now they can barely be in the same room together
(5:29 AM) Robert Seidl: Yup. Whatever team Chad ever touches.... he’ll have more than 2 cents worth of impact on... and not in a good way.
(5:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they are both student mentors…..
(5:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but they weren’t able to make it to charleston today
(5:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: THEY ARE BASICALLY ACORNS and they were doing micro financing but they pivoted to acorns
(5:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I mean come on
(5:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think this is why Starr was emphasizing that we should not be hooking up with our mentees or professors today…
