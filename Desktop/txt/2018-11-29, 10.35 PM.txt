(10:35 PM) Robert Seidl: Still, I don’t like that that happened! Lol I was struggling to stay awake in the first class so went and bought a quadruple shot of espresso and nursed it all day 
(12:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow i thought i could go without coffee today, but my eyes were shutting by my last class along with everyone else’s so I didn’t look like the odd one out haha
(12:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i just woke up from a 2 hour nap
(12:41 AM) Robert Seidl: 😕
(12:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Glad you got a nap in though! When this caffeine wears out I’ll go down hard no doubt. 
(1:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: did you ever get to fit yours in today?? i’m sorry you were falling asleep in your classes 😒
(1:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Just caffeined it lol 
(1:07 AM) Robert Seidl: *time zone so technically you had less sleep too
(1:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so worth it for me 
(1:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Would probably sound so silly to most since we just talked 😂😂😂
(1:28 AM) Robert Seidl: But I couldn’t agree more 
(1:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Selfishly it was worth it to me (but overall not worth it to me in the sense that you had an 8am class lol)
(1:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I wouldn’t have want to spend my night any other way although I will admit maybe once or twice when you’d be like “hello?” I might have fallen asleep for just a second 🤤alll the other times I was totally lost in thought 😂
(1:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you had an 8am too though
(1:37 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh no!!! Hahahaha 
(1:37 AM) Robert Seidl: You should’ve told me!!!!!!!!!!
(1:37 AM) Robert Seidl: Shefali!!!!!!!
(1:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I just thought it was funny hahahah
(1:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Funny yes but not funny 
(1:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol
(1:38 AM) Robert Seidl: And I just kept torturing you 
(1:38 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m a monster 
(1:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: torturing??? never 
(1:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if I felt that way I would have been like “okay cool so i’m going to go to sleep now”
(1:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and you gave me plenty of chances to have that reaction hahaha 
(1:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I wouldn’t even go with monster... at least say cute monster 
(1:41 AM) Robert Seidl: So a turtle dove?
(1:41 AM) Robert Seidl: Cute like a baby turtle + a monster 
(1:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wait actually so perfect 
(1:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: minus the monster part 
(1:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: = cute like baby turtle + dove 
(1:43 AM) Robert Seidl: This is not a good thing 
(1:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m into it
(1:45 AM) Robert Seidl: Just to clarify this is in reference to Simon Birch’s quote on it not being the kind of cute a guy wants to be to a girl 😂
(1:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god did I tell you when jackie and I were at dinner the other night we saw a kid that looked EXACTLY like him 
(1:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like i showed her a picture of him and we were freaked out 
(1:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha i’m aware but you will always be super cute to me 
(1:46 AM) Robert Seidl: Whattttt
(1:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah and he was crying 😢 
(1:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: in HoM
(1:46 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha 
(1:47 AM) Robert Seidl: If I was there, I would have pointed him out and been like “shefali what did you do to make Simon cry?”
(1:47 AM) Robert Seidl: “He just wanted to touch your boobs” 
(1:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god HAHAHAHAHA everyone would have hated me 
(1:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he had to leave the restaurant because he was being so loud 
(1:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: looked very uncomfortable 
(1:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: jackie and I related on a spiritual level to his distress 
(1:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I would be speechless if you said that 
(1:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Making it even more hilarious to me to induce an incredulous  expression on your face
(1:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I retract my answer- you are a monster 
(3:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼sounds familiar 
(5:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Soooo acurrate 😂
(5:41 AM) Robert Seidl: Reece texts my mom 2 hours after being at the citadel, “I hate to say it, but I’m really not liking this.”
(5:42 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol
(5:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh boy hahaha did you see it coming 
(6:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Definitely thought that was one potential reaction 
(6:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Can’t blame him.
