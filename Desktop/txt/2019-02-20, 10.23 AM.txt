(4:28 PM) Robert Seidl: Georgia you’re awesome, no need to apologize!! 😂😂😂
(4:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lmao she wanted me to show her some things to do with a weight lifting bar (which i have no idea about since these ones are not connected to the other bars ) 
(4:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s like an ugly Russian gym 
(4:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Squats 
(4:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the bars are so big and heavy 
(4:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and all the guys are scary 
(4:31 PM) Robert Seidl: 45 pounds? 
(4:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: they look like they could be part of the kgb 
(4:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: idk it’s not in lbs 
(4:32 PM) Robert Seidl: I’m sure you can do the math conversion...
(4:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: honestly i didn’t really care 
(4:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: as soon as I realized it hurt to hold 
(4:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i put it down 
(4:32 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha
(4:33 PM) Robert Seidl: A couple of light free weights and a lot of different types of squat types / lunges 
(4:33 PM) Robert Seidl: Few dozen different exercises right there 
(4:34 PM) Robert Seidl: Toning type exercises combined with lots of cardio is great for any girl 
(4:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think it was just her being disappointed that we couldn’t do what i showed her in some videos a couple days ago
(4:35 PM) Robert Seidl: She doesn’t want to lift like those guys anyways the girls who go hardcore with that aren’t cute 
(4:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that was my bad
(4:35 PM) Robert Seidl: Ahh
(4:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we did other stuff don’t worry

(4:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: was really disappointed 
(4:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya I was kind of surprised that there would maybe be a good gym like you were thinking lemon might be there
