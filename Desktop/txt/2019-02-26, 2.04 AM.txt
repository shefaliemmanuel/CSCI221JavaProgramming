(2:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Also, always feel free to call me / text me about anything youâ€™re ever feeling or thatâ€™s ever on your mind! I am obsessed with the desire for you to be  happy... as nothing makes me feel better. Iâ€™m sad you canâ€™t go with your friends next week. My fingers are always crossed that you get to have as many amazing experiences as possible! Iâ€™ve missed you tremendously the past few days. Have a great day tomorrow Shefali. Alllll my love.

I am always happy no reason to worry about me, I promise ðŸ˜Œ At the beginning of the semester I was super bummed I couldnâ€™t go with them on any of these trips, but we have a bunch of other trips planned! I am having some pretty unique experiences here in Tartu ðŸ˜‹
