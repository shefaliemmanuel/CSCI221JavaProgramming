I’m super proud of you and all your doing it’s truly awesome and I’m finding myself becoming quite your fan. I’m so proud of how you dare to do things, where most dare not risk what they’d perceive as potential failure. You’re amazingly insightful and I can tell that you’re on a path of constant daily growth that will only continue your entire life. - And because of that you’re going to enjoy the hell out of the entire journey. I also am proud of the empathy and respect you show to all of those around you while still maintaining your self respect and self love. You’re not only going to overcome any of the challenges you face in the upcoming weeks, months, and years... but I know you’re going to find ways to turn the challenges into opportunities. No matter what ever happens, it is impossible for you not to always be a tremendous success in my book because I know that you’ll never give up with whatever you feel is your mission and purpose in life.

Sleep well, and have an excellent day tomorrow S.
