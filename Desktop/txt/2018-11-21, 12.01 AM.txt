(12:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Dear god 
(12:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(12:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Tell him I said hey
(12:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he said what’s up word that 
(12:42 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol
(12:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we discovered a hype restaurant 
(12:50 AM) Robert Seidl: And...
(12:51 AM) Robert Seidl: “We discovered a hype restaurant... but I’m not going to tell you what it is”
(1:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow we forgot to make pasta 
(1:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we forgot we were making pasta and have been trying to get this huge
(1:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: moth out of my apartment 
(1:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh hahahahaha it’s CO
(1:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m sorry 
(1:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol
(2:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(2:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Somebody smoked some weed 😜
(2:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we decided to kickoff thanksgiving break by relaxing with weed lol
(3:04 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha nice 
(3:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so ummm what are the realistic chances of you coming next weekend 
(3:13 AM) Robert Seidl: It looks like I’ll have to take a couple of my finals right after that weekend, so I don’t think I’m going to be able to. 

However, it also looks like I might have more flexibility during January than I thought! (Which would be 10x better because next weekend was only going to be 2 short days of which I’d have to still be studying during that time lol) 
(3:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Also, I wish I could nab you away to Chicago for New Years, but I know that’d be really tough and might not make very much sense since you’d have literally just flown home for Christmas lol
(3:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay!! just wanted to know since i’m planning out my final study schedule as well 
(3:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I would have had to be studying the entire time too lol
(3:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: idk if i’d be too fun for new years in chicago this year
(3:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya and with the amount I realized I had to study with the finals immediately following that weekend... it would’ve actually just turned into two days of torture. Would’ve been very very challenging to pull off the required studying to say the least.
(3:19 AM) Robert Seidl: What?! Why’s that?
(3:20 AM) Robert Seidl: If “you’d” be or “it’d” be lol?
(3:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: fair enough guess it will just make it that much better when i see you in a couple of week!!
(3:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: s
(3:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: because i’m not 21
(3:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if I would be
(3:21 AM) Robert Seidl: Ohhhhh
(3:21 AM) Robert Seidl: Pfff
(3:21 AM) Robert Seidl: Fuck ya it’d still be 
(3:25 AM) Robert Seidl: 1)shafiq is having a thing at his place on New Years 2)there’s places that don’t card well AT ALL, plenty of people have fakes in Chicago too (as in every DePaul / Loyola / Northwestern student) 3)I would have plenty of places lined up that would still be fun regardless if the worst case happened and your ID was taken somewhere. We’d have fun no matter what - so many places to eat, things to do etc. etc.
(3:27 AM) Robert Seidl: But all of that isn’t to push it on you at all i know that’d be really tough scheduling wise I’m just saying that hypothetically if we were in Chicago together for New Years we’d have a blast. 
(3:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Because if you don’t get to have me as a tour guide in Chicago during holiday time this year... perhaps maybe some other time in the future 😉
(3:32 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d do NYC with you sometime in the future as well of course 
(3:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hummmmmm that sounds really tempting what date range were you thinking 
(3:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m planning on going to NY in January!!
(3:53 AM) Robert Seidl: Welllll.. if you happened to find yourself in Chicago on the 28th or 29th... we could do the weekend and then New Years on Monday, and perhaps from that I could turn around and accompany you back down to Charleston.... 

Just hypothesesizing.
(3:53 AM) Robert Seidl: (And yes the misspelling is intentional)
(3:54 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d book us a hotel in the city for a couple or few nights.
(5:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hummmmmmm that does sound very exciting, but my mom will be coming back on the 27th sooo 
(5:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg please come back to charleston with me
(5:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: if it happens
(5:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh no definitely you gotta be there when your Madre gets back!!
(5:10 AM) Robert Seidl: But yes hypothetically that is the way we would do it. I’d fly back with ya. 
(5:16 AM) Robert Seidl: La familia es muy importante 
(5:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Lo mas importante*
(5:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’re welcome to spend new years in chs!!!
(5:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ll have to think about it in Chicago!!
(5:26 AM) Robert Seidl: -100 pressure 
(5:27 AM) Robert Seidl: As in 100 less than “zero pressure”
(5:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha I appreciate it 
(5:11 PM) Robert Seidl: Happy thanksgiving!!!

(11:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(11:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: commence the shopping spree 
(11:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i just had my first vegetarian thanksgiving 
(1:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also a couple of my friends who go to school in chicago gave me a list of places that are chill on ID’s
(2:13 AM) Robert Seidl: Good! There’s tons! 
(2:14 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re doing Black Friday?
(2:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is the first year i’ve legit found nothing to buy after going to 3 malls.... 
(2:43 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha 
(2:44 AM) Robert Seidl: With how I struggle with places like ikea... can’t  imagine how I’d feel if I went Black Friday shopping
(2:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg wait have you never been???
(2:44 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol
(2:44 AM) Robert Seidl: No
(2:57 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼Big G (what we call grandpa)
(2:58 AM) Robert Seidl: We haven’t eaten yet, and it’ll still be earlier than we normally eat lol 
(3:06 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(3:10 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s comments like this that make me and my siblings collectively cringe... -My dad to my mom as he’s walking around with the turkey, “I’ll carry the turkey since you carried my turkeys for 36 months”
(3:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you gotta go just once 
(3:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: for the experience 
(3:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ya know 
(3:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he’s adorable and that looks AMAZINGGGG
(3:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahhahahahaha I love that so much 
(3:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: dad jokes are the best jokes 
(3:59 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha I can’t believe I’m saying this but I think if you asked me to try it with you I would 
(4:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: will you go black Friday shopping with me
(4:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha
(4:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Tomorrow?!
(4:01 AM) Robert Seidl: K I’ll start walking south now 
(4:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahahhahaha I meant like in the future but sure
(4:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this year works 
(4:05 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: see you in a couple of days 🥶
(4:56 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(5:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: looks like he’s saving his kisses until he’s under the mistletoe 
(5:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Good morning! I spoke to the rents about new years... they are always like it’s your decision, but they would prefer for me not to go back up to Chicago for weather reasons.
They were like you can go anywhere that doesn’t have winter storms 🥶Also had a dream about ya-only rated PG
(5:07 PM) Robert Seidl: No problem at all! Completely understand! 

I guess that’s one way to know it’s a dream — if it stays PG. If I was actually there in person it’s at least be rated...
(5:07 PM) Robert Seidl: PG-13
(6:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(6:24 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so I said I didn’t go black Friday shopping in person but nothing about online
(10:56 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahahah
