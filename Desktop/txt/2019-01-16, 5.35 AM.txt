(5:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Nail filer! 
(5:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol it’s attached to my skin tho 
(5:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh yours are real
(5:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ½ the nail is off and ½ is attached to my skin
(5:36 AM) Robert Seidl: I thought most girls nails were fake 
(5:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah I hate fake nails 
(5:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: have never tried them
(5:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: most girls do 
(5:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but it’s so bad for you 
(5:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: most girls do have fake nails*
(5:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Why are there so many times where I suddenly feel like I’m in class and you’re the teacher...
(5:37 AM) Robert Seidl: Ok ya you being the teacher is hot
(5:37 AM) Robert Seidl: I enjoyed that thought 
(5:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha you enjoyed what
(5:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you should be a teacher
(5:38 AM) Robert Seidl: You and I as teachers would have other teachers making bad assumptions because of the students they’d see constantly trying to flirt with us.....
(5:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i feel like i’m in class with you sometimes too but i’m very into it 
(5:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we’d get such bad reps 
(5:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: even if we did nothing 
(5:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i actually just watched a movie on this on the plane 
(5:41 AM) Robert Seidl: Exactly 
(5:42 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d have to act so damn stand offish to any girls 
(5:43 AM) Robert Seidl: In a way you and I always have been and always will be teachers.
(5:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I didn’t realize how unintentionally flirty I was till I started teaching 
(5:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no one thought I was into them but the only way I would seem like I wasn’t flirting was if I had no emotions or wouldn’t look them in the eye 
(5:44 AM) Robert Seidl: We crave learning new things and are both super curious... but then also enjoy sharing that with other people. 
(5:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: maybe that wasn’t all on me tho 
(5:45 AM) Robert Seidl: Only thing is we’re both too ambitious to only be teachers 
(5:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’re not wrong- I hate how people act like you can’t learn stuff from people who aren’t as accomplished as you or the year below in college for example
(5:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you can always do it on the side or as a retirement job!
(5:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Side job takes more time away from other activities than people think.... plus I wouldn’t be able to actively teach and not pour nothing less than my heart and souls into it..
(5:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: who says you can’t pour your heart and soul into a side job? 
(5:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: as long as you’re enjoying it you will make time
(5:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: for t
(5:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it
(5:48 AM) Robert Seidl: I agree with that school of thought —to an extent—
(5:49 AM) Robert Seidl: In fact being all over the place and doing everything is my default state to an extreme so I kind of have to self talk myself into tempering it
(5:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I perform at my peak when i’m doing just a tad more then what I think I can handle 
(5:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Balance is necessary and that balance threshold is different for everybody. But you’d  definitely be right to say that most people (including me sometimes no doubt) underestimate and avoid their balance threshold simply because they’re trying to avoid pain.
(5:52 AM) Robert Seidl: ^^i think most people do. You have to grow and expand. 
(5:56 AM) Robert Seidl: To me starting a teaching job would actually be more apathetic and far less painful than many of the other things I’m trying to do.
(5:56 AM) Robert Seidl: At the moment that is.
(5:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Nowww if I was going to teach computer science or math.... that’d be fucking painful 😂😂😂
(5:57 AM) Robert Seidl: For me and the students 
(5:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the professors that I am close with have all done incredible things with their lives and then come back to teach for a more stable lifestyle 
(5:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I can’t tell you how frustrated they seem when they have to go through ⅝ steps to get something approved
(5:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: when it took them 1 or 2 steps before 
(5:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: why would someone want to start their life or there
(6:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: MY VISA CAME IN
(6:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya I’ve heard quite a bit from professors I like the bureaucratic nightmare they go through  
(6:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Yayyy!!!!
(6:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol was going to follow the yay with a joke but couldn’t think of anything above sub par
(6:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: let’s hear it 
(6:04 AM) Robert Seidl: They’re gone 
(6:04 AM) Robert Seidl: Dust in the wind 
(6:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(6:10 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼Guess I’ll just hop on this bus..
(6:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHHAHAHA EXCUSE ME 
(6:12 AM) Robert Seidl: What you don’t want to be left behind?
(6:12 AM) Robert Seidl: If you try to sit next to me I’ll respond “seats taken” (with the Forrest Gump accent)
(6:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: after whore school your female students really wont be able to resist you 
(6:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but I will 😂
(6:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I won’t take up that seat next to you but if you change your mind there’s always a seat for you next to me going to Nerd Academy 
(6:19 AM) Robert Seidl: School for people with non erosive reflux disease?
(6:20 AM) Robert Seidl: No thanks 
(6:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow you’re so funny 
(6:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m dying 
(6:22 AM) Robert Seidl: Thanks 
(6:23 AM) Robert Seidl: They tell me I’m the class clown at whore school, because I don’t wear any makeup.... isn’t that ironic?
(6:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh sweetie it’s just cause your jokes are that funny
(6:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I was just laughing, right??
(6:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t think about it to much or your head might start hurting 
(6:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Ok
(6:27 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m not thinking and am in the fetal position 
(6:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what’s wrong 
(6:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Nothing 
(6:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Just trying not to think 
(6:28 AM) Robert Seidl: So I couldn’t tell you what even if something was 
(6:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it helps if you eat ice cream 
(6:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and dive into the flavor 
(6:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ice cream + fetal position + blanket + netflix
(6:29 AM) Robert Seidl: Hi
(6:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hey
(6:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Hi
(6:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no
(6:30 AM) Robert Seidl: I don’t have to think much to say hi
(6:30 AM) Robert Seidl: So..
(6:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Hi
(6:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: maybe you can try to think 
(6:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what’s something they make you do at whore school
(6:31 AM) Robert Seidl: I can’t get out of the not thinking loop..
(6:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Because that would require thinking..
(6:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Hi 
(6:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: get a puppy 
(6:32 AM) Robert Seidl: Bend over 
(6:32 AM) Robert Seidl: *Ben Dover he’s what I’ll name my puppy 
(6:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what breed is ben
(6:33 AM) Robert Seidl: He’s either a cock or spaniel 
(6:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: look at that you’ve been thinking 
(6:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so proud of you
(6:34 AM) Robert Seidl: My condolences.. making jokes like this is part of whore school
(6:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no this is just you
(6:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh wait the teacher at whore school just told me this is normal college...
(6:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Apparently whore school is another name for college 
(6:36 AM) Robert Seidl: And apparently College of Charleston is one of the highest ranked!! 
(6:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha jk jk 
(6:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so you want to make this personal 
(6:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol
(6:37 AM) Robert Seidl: Who else are we talking about right now if not one of us two persons..
(6:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: goodnight 
(6:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Hi 
(6:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha 
(6:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I can’t even defend it- college of charleston has so many whore, but any school that has been ranked in the top 20 party schools in the US would
(6:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: at least we have parties tho....
(6:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha I’m not actually saying that it was just the tail end of that joke 
(6:40 AM) Robert Seidl: And it was low hanging fruit 
(6:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: most of your jokes are lol
(6:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but you’re not wrong is what i’m saying
(6:42 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints 
(6:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hummmm
(6:48 AM) Robert Seidl: I’ve always felt sweeping generalizations like that were dumb and I met plenty of girls there (you being tops and definitely my favorite 😉) that were not like that at all. 
(6:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the majority i’ve met have been quite the opposite 
(6:49 AM) Robert Seidl: Change of topic but you honestly seem 10x more like a down to earth midwestern girl than a southern girl. 
(6:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Haha not surprised, and probably the same for me... but I always gravitate towards people who march to their own beat.
(6:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Those are the people I always end up becoming close with 
(6:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the ones who march to their own beat 
(6:53 AM) Robert Seidl: May fall asleep at any moment btw but enjoying the banter 
(6:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol same 
(6:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Really though (here comes a sweeping generalization) most southern girls are so much more full of themselves 
(6:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Let’s pass out trying to dream about each other at the same time! 
(6:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Love you so much kiddo 
(6:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Night 
(6:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: love you more 
(6:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: goodnight 
(2:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: haven’t been dreaming much lately... was more of a continuation of a thought I had when I was ½ asleep on the plane 
(2:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: regarding us
(2:52 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya? 
(3:00 PM) e:: but we were in my high schools uniform in your apartment??
(3:44 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha ya weird shit like that happens in my dreams too
(3:45 PM) Robert Seidl: Are you telling me I hooked up with high school you?
(3:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we were the same age we are now lol and we just fucked on your sofa with the blinds open 
(3:59 PM) Robert Seidl: In your high school uniforms though?
(3:59 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha 
(4:00 PM) Robert Seidl: Kinky 
(5:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol idk why we weren’t naked 
(5:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: remember that political comedy show we watched with mia 
(5:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: an episode got banned on netflix HAHAHA
(5:27 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and he was a political science major at UC Davis 
(5:32 PM) Robert Seidl: Netflix is extremely liberal 😂
(5:33 PM) Robert Seidl: Would be almost impossible to get banned from it 😂
(5:33 PM) Robert Seidl: If you’re a leftist commentator 
(6:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: wowwww a girl from cofc is stating that if you are a female against the  
(6:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: gillette commercial then you are not a feminist 
(8:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh hey also this is the reminder to send my parents a card
(8:32 PM) Robert Seidl: You better get back in line Shefali! And you better dump that toxic boyfriend of yours! Otherwise you’re not a good woke woman, you’re a bully, and you’re part of the problem missy! 😂

Isn’t it ironic that it is modern “liberals” who don’t want others to think freely and at all differently from their authoritarian views? 

Being a woke leftist looks a lot less like political discourse, and a lot more like a bigoted, intolerant religion.
(1:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha I was shook 
(1:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: She got a lot of hate 
(1:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: got an update on kylie (clemson/ you met at brunch) : the guy from the bar that she is obsessed with ghosted her  
(1:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but they have 3 classes together and he keeps sitting in front of her and then keeps looking at her throughout the class 
(1:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she’s ready to confront him 
(1:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but won’t snap him first 
(1:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂
(1:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😬*
(3:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Is that the guy she was studying with and nervous to talk to?
(3:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the guy she made out with at the bar
(3:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the night before he drove to texas 
(3:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she called when i was. on the phone w you
(3:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Ahhh ok ok 
(3:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol can he “ghost” her if they randomly made out  at a bar?
(3:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i mean they non stop chatted for 3 weeks after it
(3:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Ok ok important details
(3:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: haha sorry
(3:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: anyone can ghost anyone 
(3:41 AM) Robert Seidl: Haha you’re good!
(3:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i told her to find someone better at her mixer tonight
(3:42 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes!
(3:42 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s exactly what she needs to do!
(3:46 AM) Robert Seidl: She should line up several prospects and just enjoy getting to know different guys! Choose from a place of confidence and non-scarcity who she spends her precious time with! Plus she’ll make less mistakes (like deciding to “confront” some guy she’s not even dating hahaha) and not blow it with the guys she likes if she knows she has other options! And she can accomplish all of that without making out with a single one if she doesn’t want to! 
(3:49 AM) Robert Seidl: On the one guy... “confront” is probably a bad idea. He’s not her boyfriend. They made out once. He doesn’t owe her anything and she doesn’t owe him anything. 

If a girl I had kissed once “confronted” me incredulously a giant neon red flag would start flashing in my brain: danger danger stage 9 drama.. avoid avoid.. avoid all contact..
(3:51 AM) Robert Seidl: And if he’s snapping her and talking to her digitally but doesn’t even have the balls to TALK to her in person he’s a little bitch and not worth any girl of quality’s time anyways. 
(3:55 AM) Robert Seidl: I mean.. unless he’s in 6th grade. Then she should give him a couple years to mature..
(3:57 AM) Robert Seidl: And since this guy sounds pretty immature he’ll probably like her far more once he realizes she has other guys who are options 
(4:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she’s obsessed w this guy 
(4:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and “no one is hotter”
(4:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the thing is that she doesn’t care if he’s smart or not he just has to look good 
(4:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol she would make out with all of them 
(4:13 AM) Robert Seidl: To each their own I guess 
(4:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and maybe even judge them partially based on it
(4:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he’s a child 
(4:14 AM) Robert Seidl: What I exclamation marked: she is a stage 9
(4:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but he’s been in long term relationships his whole life 
(4:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so maybe he just doesn’t know what to do now 
(4:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ROBBY CHILL 
(4:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’re right tho and she knows it
(4:20 AM) Robert Seidl: Welp. If she wants to get him, the firssssttt step would be to talk to him (in person). The second step would be to flirt with him. The third step would be for her to hint that she’d like him to set a definite time for just the two of them (or she can just ask herself). The fourth step (and this should actually be executed starting tonight at the mixer) is for her to cultivate other options even if she swears she’s 99% this guys the only guy for her lol.
(4:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(4:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not sure if you wanted an update on the nail but here it is!!
(4:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: came off in the shower
(4:21 AM) Robert Seidl: Of course I do! You’re hurt! 
(4:21 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m sorry kiddo.
(4:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: all of your steps SOBER
(4:21 AM) Robert Seidl: I always want updates on anything and everything you ever feel like sharing with me 😁
(4:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: is the key
(4:22 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m Kylie level obsessed hahaha with talking to you about pretty much everything 
(4:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHAHA 
(4:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: stage 9...
(4:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: doesn’t sound too good
(4:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: AVOID... AVOID... AVOID ALL CONTACT 
(4:23 AM) Robert Seidl: I mean... cats been out of the bag since I first realized and admitted I was falling in love with you 
(4:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha nice 
(4:24 AM) Robert Seidl: That was pretty good
(4:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Got me there 
(4:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha no one else i’d want to be kylie level of obsessed with 
(4:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Uh ohhhh 😮 
(4:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you should run startingggg
(4:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: NOW
(4:26 AM) Robert Seidl: If we’re both Kylie level obsessed with each other that’s dangerous....
(4:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: good dangerous
(4:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Potentially veryyy good dangerous 
(4:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Part of me felt I should run from you by like the second day 
(4:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😢
(4:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Because all of the signs pointed to us having massive chemistry and the if I let it go longer I was going to be sucked into that Kylie level obsession eventually 😂😂😂
(4:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Truth be told though.... how kyle thinks she’s obsessed with this guy... probably isn’t in the same universe as us....
(4:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Levels
(4:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah not at all
(4:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: she gets “obsessed” every time she gets attention 
(4:29 AM) Robert Seidl: Haha awe
(4:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: from a male
(4:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: an attractive *
(4:29 AM) Robert Seidl: I really want to help her out actually 
(4:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we gotta go out with her 
(4:29 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes we do
(4:30 AM) Robert Seidl: We’d get her like 10+ numbers / dates set up in one NIGHT 
(4:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you gotta come to 5 points with us 
(4:30 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha I’m down
(4:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: every time I would get hit on their I would make sure they had a friend- get them hooked up with kylie and then leave that guy lol
(4:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Probably not the most efficient for getting her anything other than an attractive guy to go home with her... if she’s into that
(4:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s all she’s into 
(4:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he just has to not be a complete idiot 
(4:32 AM) Robert Seidl: Welp. Miss Kylie better be strapping.
(4:32 AM) Robert Seidl: And even then she better be inspecting certain areas in good lighting before any contact 😂😂😂
(4:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Isn’t she a virgin?
(4:34 AM) Robert Seidl: Call back whenever no rush if you’re busy.
(11:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼￼￼
(11:57 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(1:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Jealous 
(2:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼￼￼
(2:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha funny stuff 
(2:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Is that middle one real?! (It has to be cropped 😂)
(2:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no idea hahaha
(2:10 AM) Robert Seidl: Even if it’s fake it’s still funny 
(2:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Holy shit actually making me hungry for a Big Mac... I’m convinced all in the Hogwarts library can hear my stomach growling right now..
(2:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh boy 
(2:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: uber eats that
(2:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha poor thing 
(2:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: when’s the last time you ate something 
(2:49 AM) Robert Seidl: Protein shake..
(2:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Ehh this morning
(2:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Im good
(2:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: bless your hungry heart 
(2:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Will slaughter any livestock I see on the drive home though..
(2:51 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d still rather eat...
(2:51 AM) Robert Seidl: You though. 
(2:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahaha 
(2:52 AM) Robert Seidl: I think my mouth waters more to bury my face between your legs than it does the Big Mac even right now.
(2:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh wow 
(2:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: well it’s restaurant week in chs!!
(5:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Never been to it! What’s it like?
(5:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s just a bunch of restaurants that have specials... mainly 3 course meals for $35-55 at places like Rue De Jean, PawPaw, Peninsula Grill, and Oak Steak House.....
(6:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol sounds dangerous 
(6:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Love ru de Jean and oak 
(6:16 AM) Robert Seidl: They must be owned by the same person?
(6:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh yeah i’m glad I wasn’t here for most of it this week- ends on the 20th
(6:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s just all the restaurants in charleston 
(6:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they do it 2x a year
(6:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: side note: are you a big tulip person
(6:40 AM) Robert Seidl: What’s a tulip even look like lol?
(6:42 AM) Robert Seidl: No I’m not big on tulips even though I don’t know what they look like... given how things turned out in the 1630’s
(6:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(6:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(6:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol these are from the Amsterdam Tulip  Festival
(6:45 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes! Tied back to the Tulip mania when the Dutch were convinced tulips were basically gold for a year 😂 
(6:46 AM) Robert Seidl: In 1636 that field would’ve bought you France. By the end of 1637 it would of maybe bought you a meal. 
(6:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol 1637 was a sad year
(6:48 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya, 1636 though... that was a Wild year for me 
(6:48 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: tell me about the good old days
(6:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I honestly have no idea
(6:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Well, I bought all of my tulips on credit so after 1637 I spent the rest of my life in debtors prison... was reincarnated a few times since then (once as a donkey - I know ironic given my love of the left) 
(6:51 AM) Robert Seidl: The time that I was a donkey was in Mexico..
(6:51 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s why I love that Mexican place el burro loco so much (or at least used to)..
(6:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it must have been hard being a jack ass
(6:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: used to??
(6:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Most believe I still am
(6:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: shocker
(6:53 AM) Robert Seidl: Like that movie the jerk you loved so much..
(6:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Marky mark wants to play me in a fresh take on it but based on my life called the jackass 
(6:54 AM) Robert Seidl: The name of the girl the jackass falls in love with is Shefalania
(6:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼I knew you looked familiar when I met you 😉
(6:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t know a Shefalania
(6:55 AM) Robert Seidl: You even know about thattt?!!
(6:55 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m impressed 
(6:56 AM) Robert Seidl: Would’ve definitely thought before your time
(6:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: only the coolest kids did stuff from the movie in middle school and got suspended
(6:58 AM) Robert Seidl: I may have been a bit of a jokester in junior high... but I was far too persuasive to ever get in any serious trouble 
(6:58 AM) Robert Seidl: Just a couple detentions 
(6:58 AM) Robert Seidl: And Ben and brad were always dumbfounded that I somehow avoided all of the detentions I did
(6:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sounds like a talent haha
(6:59 AM) Robert Seidl: 1637 ..... and 2005.....
(6:59 AM) Robert Seidl: The two years I peaked
