(12:46 AM) Robert Seidl: Heâ€™s very smart and has good grades, but I think heâ€™s right on the cusp of really turning the switch up to start really excelling to his full potential. Lol my biggest worry is he gets too distracted from all of the female attention heâ€™s going to get in college ðŸ˜‚
(12:49 AM) Robert Seidl: Itâ€™s absolutely hilarious observing him interacting with the girls in his school.. heâ€™ll walk by them and every single one of their heads turn and watch him constantly, but he still is somehow completely oblivious and doesnâ€™t seem to care ðŸ˜†
(12:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol amazingggg he sounds adorable if he can make it through freshman year he can make it through anything
(12:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: where does he want to go
(12:53 AM) Robert Seidl: Heâ€™s currently thinking about TCU, The Citadel, or SMU it sounds like. 
(12:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I donâ€™t know if I am supsuto answer that question
(12:54 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: technically ill be a senior by credit at the end of this sem??
(12:54 AM) Robert Seidl: Wait.. oh my god would he potentially be in college while you were still in college...?!!!!!!
(12:55 AM) Robert Seidl: What.. the.. fuck....
(12:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: â€¦â€¦.

(12:56 AM) Robert Seidl: Iâ€™m dying 
(12:57 AM) Robert Seidl: ....and if he ended up going to the citadel....?!!!!!
(12:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just same city
(12:57 AM) Robert Seidl: ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
(12:59 AM) Robert Seidl: If you saw him at all I guess it would be a positive that you could keep too distracting of girls away from him or at least warn me ðŸ˜‚
(1:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: your poor brother hahahha
(1:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Just tell all of the girls who might be shallow at CofC that heâ€™s off limits
(1:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh for sure ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
(1:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: good think I teach freshmen- they will spread the word
(1:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha
(1:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 95% of CofC females have no heart, horrible people, or are looking for their MRS degree as they would say
(1:03 AM) Robert Seidl: I mean Iâ€™d definitely want him to date cool girls that would blow his mind but just none of the ones with poor hearts / character / trying to get married right away. 
(1:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: soooo I think it would be a skill to weed them out heâ€™d acquire quickly
(1:08 AM) Robert Seidl: Yaaaa but I mean some girls are just talented at hiding those things if they lock in on a certain guy they realllyyy want.... so I hope. Iâ€™m not as worried though as I was when my little sister went to college though OBVIOUSLY. 
(1:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I get it lol if he ends up going to the Citadel I will for sure let you know if heâ€™s taking to some not so lovely girls
(1:13 AM) Robert Seidl: Iâ€™m still blown away by the fact that heâ€™ll be in college when you are ðŸ˜‚
(1:14 AM) Robert Seidl: Did you end up going to the concert in Georgia?!!
(1:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it could work in your favor Iâ€™m sure you have a million, but I have a couple friends at the Citadel that could keep their eye out for him ðŸ˜‰
(1:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: nopee the chances of it randomly raining/storming during the festival were too high
(1:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Ahhh gotcha 
(1:17 AM) Robert Seidl: How goes the Saturday?
