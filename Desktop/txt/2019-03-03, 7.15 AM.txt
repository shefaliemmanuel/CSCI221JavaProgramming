(7:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sweet dreams have a good last day of weekend classes tmr 
(7:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Thanks! Should I be saying good morning or goodnight to you?
(7:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: good morning 
(7:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol
(7:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha k never know it was a Saturday! Did you sleep well?
(7:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ðŸ˜‚ this time yesterday was a goodnight
(7:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yes I knocked out last night 
(7:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: how was your day?
(7:21 AM) Robert Seidl: It was good! Class is going well and the professor seems to think I know the material  somehow (which is not really the case - international investment arbitration rules and procedures are ALL, OVER, the fucking place and very complicated lol)
(7:22 AM) Robert Seidl: And many times thereâ€™s an inherent lack of logic or reason to it.... hahaha I think youâ€™d hate it 
(7:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: smarty pants 
(7:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it seems like youâ€™re on his good side in that case??
(7:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: which is AWESOME 
(7:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I feel like youâ€™re probably that student that always knows his material 
(7:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: good job ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“
(7:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Iâ€™m on his good side so far it seems I was still slightly worried that girl might have said something... this is the kind of guy who would for sure be biased (usually donâ€™t have to deal with that too much in law school)
(7:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: knock on wood
(7:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: happy for youuuuu
(7:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that type of person shouldnâ€™t exist in academia 
(7:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Everyoneâ€™s biased. Including me, no matter how hard we try. But itâ€™s rare for anyone to be bad about that at WashU (also keep in mind I could be wrong on this guy thatâ€™s just my gut feeling) 
(7:39 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohh youâ€™ve never heard of him doing stuff like that 
(7:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Whispers 
(7:40 AM) Robert Seidl: But I overhear so much drama in the law school ðŸ˜‚
(7:41 AM) Robert Seidl: I just never engage in those conversations but it can be interesting to listen as a bystander lol 
(7:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha I normally end up subconsciously listening because they are sitting toooo close and iâ€™m not doing anything that needs all my attention
