(8:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: guess who’s been having migraines and wears their airpods constantly....?????
(8:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: alsoooo found out the root cause of why sophia doesn’t work out is because whenever she does her entire face turns red and stays like that for the rest of the day 
(8:33 PM) Robert Seidl: Who? 
(8:34 PM) Robert Seidl: Hopefully not you! 😬
(10:24 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: sophiaaaaaaa

(10:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: how’s ya day been
(12:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Sure sign of the apocalypse: my labor law professor said she owes me extra credit because I helped her with something tech related....
(12:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Full disclosure.. all I did was exit out of a presentation she couldn’t get out of that was on the screen (and I STILL wasn’t 100% sure I’d be able to do it easily 😂) 
(12:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ve never been so proud of you 
(12:08 AM) Robert Seidl: The irony wasn’t lost on me... if you were there you probably just would’ve started laughing out loud. 
(12:09 AM) Robert Seidl: But yes I become more convinced all of the time that the air pods are the devil haha 
(12:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh as soon as the professor wasn’t looking 
(12:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 10000%
(12:10 AM) Robert Seidl: You’re going to kill your Econ final 
(12:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: level 2: opening up FaceTime and location open screen 
(12:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I wanna see it happen 
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: level 2^
(12:11 AM) Robert Seidl: Location open? 
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: haha thanks I was just reviewing Sophia was like just go to bed 
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I can’t sleep
(12:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I’ve been laying  here for an hour 
(12:12 AM) Robert Seidl: She’s right. You’re going to do awesome. 
(12:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we shall see 
(12:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ve got all morning to prepare as well 
(12:13 AM) Robert Seidl: I can call to say hi... and the only reason I’m even considering that is because my phone has 20% battery left and would die if I went too long 
(12:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay!
(1:57 AM) Robert Seidl: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8r6fqc6jtaI
(1:57 AM) Robert Seidl: I think I only heard around the first 20-30 minutes and it was while I was working out... so not sure on the quality but it did sound eerily similar and the takeaway feeling I had is that this girl is playing chubby...
(1:59 AM) Robert Seidl: Sleep well! You’ll do great tomorrow!
