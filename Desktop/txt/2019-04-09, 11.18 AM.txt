(11:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: thank youuu
(11:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I slept super well
(11:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and I just finished my crypto hw T- 2 hours of debugging!!
(11:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m hype for this final 
(11:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think I actually prefer classes where the final exam is 100% of the grade
(11:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: have an amazing dayyyy turtle doveeee
(3:44 PM) Robert Seidl: Pretty sure I stopped listening around 20 mins. Yes! I’m glad you should be hype 😜
(3:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that was some fuck shit
(3:49 PM) Robert Seidl: 😳
(3:49 PM) Robert Seidl: Explain 
(3:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the questions were nothing like the mock (which is what I expected)

(3:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he brought up case studies that we hadn’t even discussed- but i think those questions were okay since I understood the principle 
(3:52 PM) Robert Seidl: You’ll be separated from the herd even more then
(3:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he made 2 or 3 questions look extremely similar to the mock but they asked for the complete opposite answer 
(3:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: well after the exam we were all discussing answers and everyone had but B for example 
(3:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: A) rational
B) Procedural 
C) quasi hyperbole 
(3:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: everyone put B but the answer was A because in the specific chapter we discussed Behavioral, Rational, and Procedural Rational 
(3:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and I specifically asked him in procedural and procedural rational were the same thing in this case and he said they were completely different 
(3:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: some were stupid like that
(3:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m just scared of the trick questions I didn’t catch 
(3:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: these were questions I was discussing with the kids who studied every week with me
(3:55 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t even want to know how the kids who didn’t come to lecture did
(3:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: there was defiantly some stuff that you would have only remember the example if he spoke about it in class
(3:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if I don’t do well then I can take the resit at the end of May
(3:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I know for a fact I got all of his wild math problems correct
(3:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I should get my result tonight
(3:57 PM) Robert Seidl: You’re going to do great I can tell 
(3:57 PM) Robert Seidl: No one else was as prepared 
(3:58 PM) Robert Seidl: And yes you could always decide to be picky about your grade and grab those extra few points 😉😜
(3:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we’ll see 
(3:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I am not a happy camper 
(4:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: sophia is making me try painting 😂
(4:00 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Also this will heavily impact my admission to an MBA
(4:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: since this is the only master business class I have taken
(4:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: any who
(4:01 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: how’s ya day been ☺️

(8:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: kinda pissed I didn’t get an A but the average was an E
(8:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so im thankful!!
(8:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha the average?!!
(8:38 PM) Robert Seidl: I knowwww I figured...
(8:38 PM) Robert Seidl: That makes me 😡 that he didn’t give you an A 
(8:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: me toooooo
(8:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I wanna know if it was just 1 question or something
(8:38 PM) Robert Seidl: He knows he could have 
(8:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: no one got an A
(8:38 PM) Robert Seidl: Fuck 
(8:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: last years final scores had B as the highest
(8:39 PM) Robert Seidl: That loser 
(8:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he’s too rational to give an A 😂
(8:39 PM) Robert Seidl: Ok he’s just a prick 
(8:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also he doesn’t curve at all his grading is straight up
(8:39 PM) Robert Seidl: No, he’s irrational 
(8:39 PM) Robert Seidl: He does give someone an A....
(8:39 PM) Robert Seidl: Himself 
(8:39 PM) Robert Seidl: That’s what it’s about 
(8:39 PM) Robert Seidl: His ego 
(8:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I just wish school I apply to can see that its the highest he gives out!!
(8:40 PM) Robert Seidl: You NEED to tell them and show them! 
(8:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: can you even do that?
(8:41 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes 
(8:42 PM) Robert Seidl: You can attach disclaimers / explanations on some applications 
(8:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhhh wow
(8:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay
(8:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: noted
(8:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we’ll see if he gives any this year
(8:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: there are 2 more batches of exams
(8:42 PM) Robert Seidl: First, go to him... explain how it is in the states and with that application process, and how they won’t understand, and try to persuade him to give you an A.
(8:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: for this course
(8:43 PM) Robert Seidl: Why not, you earned it, so you might as well try 
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I am going to ask him to see my exam
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so if I legit didnt get an A I don’t want him to give me one
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hes someone who would like incredible for recs
(8:43 PM) Robert Seidl: (Granted it obvi will still look good that you did well in that kind of class but don’t tell him that)
(8:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and I know for a fact he would write me one
(8:45 PM) Robert Seidl: Ahhh I see. Then maybe passively mention how some schools might not like the B in America but that you still loved the class and were honored to have taken it with him.
(8:45 PM) Robert Seidl: You can say it that way..
(8:45 PM) Robert Seidl: You had the top grade... you earned an A 
(8:47 PM) Robert Seidl: I’m very, very proud of you.
(8:56 PM) Robert Seidl: You’re a boss ass bitch 😜
(9:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha I opened the email with asking him how he’s enjoying a book I recommended 
(9:13 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hopefully he will meet with me within the next few weeks
(9:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also really wanna send a passive aggressive email to the econ chair at cofc 
(9:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: bc he told me I will fail 
(9:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and wasn’t going to approve the course
(9:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and I had to fight with him about it
(9:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that was one of the main reason I wanted to do well 
(9:15 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: fight as in politely exchange multiple conversation about how i’m not qualified and he was like “you’re stupid if you take this class” “go away”
(9:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but I feel like it’s best not to email him
