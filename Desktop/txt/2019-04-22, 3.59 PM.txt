(12:38 AM) Robert Seidl: This would really make a lot of Silicon Valley environmentalists disappointed when they thought the Tesla they were driving was sooo much better for the earth than anyone else’s car.
(12:44 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼Btw I also noticed that yesterday google had nothing special done to its main page for Easter... the most important Holliday for over a billion Christians in the world. But don’t worry... Google mad sure to celebrate earth day!

(7:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I would still buy a tesla over any other car tbh 
(7:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so much salt 
(7:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I mean why should companies celebrate religious events 
(7:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if their audience is people from multiple religions 
(7:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: either celebrate all or none
(7:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ya know
(7:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: also I don’t have class on Wednesday’s so i’ll be up tonight to text!
(8:24 PM) Robert Seidl: I was under the false impression that google had done doodles for other holidays like Ramadan and Kwanza. I did some digging.. I was wrong. They’ve avoided religious holidays, so as long as they’ve done that, I agree with the policy. 
(8:26 PM) Robert Seidl: You driving a Tesla is a scary thought with all of that acceleration and no one able to hear you coming 😂
(8:27 PM) Robert Seidl: A Tesla would be the first car I’d get if I was to ever not have a truck.
