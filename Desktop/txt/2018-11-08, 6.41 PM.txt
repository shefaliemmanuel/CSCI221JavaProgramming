(6:41 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol sounds to me like you’re on your way to earning an A then. Just showing the kind of effort it sounds like you do makes a big difference to teachers in how they grade (whether they admit it or not). Also, if it does end up being that bad and you therefore persist on more extra credit, then she’ll probably A) ease your concerns and tell you you’re fine or B) give you some way to earn the grade you want. Sounds like she’s on your side and rooting for you to do well.
