(8:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we got our 5th roommate last night 
(8:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: maybe she has morning classes too
(11:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow america is hated here
(6:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: in both my classes today I could feel the hatred for USA
(6:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: especially in my business ethics class
(6:23 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and I didn’t tell anyone i’m from american but I know they can tell
(6:24 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and a couple said they didn’t expect my perspective coming from an american 
(6:29 PM) Robert Seidl: It’s pretty interesting how assumptive and stereotyping many other people are against Americans and simultaneously see Americans as the “judgemental” or bigoted ones when they know nothing about us.... yet it would be completely against American polite societal norms to openly judge someone based on where they come from. So the question must be asked, “who are the real intolerant ones?” 
(6:32 PM) Robert Seidl: Furthermore, I highlyyyy doubt Estonia or the university in Tartu is very “diverse”. Rather it is probably an almost utterly homogenous place. Whereas America is actually a completely diverse melting pot of all shapes and colors of people bringing an almost total blending of perspectives... and all of these different people are united and accepted as Americans. 
(6:35 PM) Robert Seidl: You could live in Estonia for 10 or more years and apply to become an Estonian citizen.... yet you’d never be considered an Estonian. Such is true of most other countries in the world. 

Yet if someone comes to the US and applies to be a citizen because they love America they are embraced by 99% of people here as Americans. 
(6:39 PM) Robert Seidl: Furthermore the mainstream media in the US clearly doesn’t represent the views of most Americans. The mainstream almost seems to hate America and the freedom it stands for, while praising authoritarian regimes like China that are utterly oppressive and Orwellian to their own people. What other people see in other countries is the mainstream media’s depiction of the US. 
(6:41 PM) Robert Seidl: But if you’re used to authoritarian societies or even support them... then a nation like the US that gives its diverse citizens more freedom, rights, and personal choice, and economic opportunity than any other place... then that place would be seen as evil or the enemy. 
(6:54 PM) Robert Seidl: I’m curious, does Tartu seem to be more in line with ethnic Russians?... or with native Estonians?
(6:56 PM) Robert Seidl: I wonder if the university and its students is slightly different than the overall population in terms of their views on Americans.
(6:57 PM) Robert Seidl: I would’ve expected some Estonians to vastly prefer Americans to Russian influence or control. 
(7:41 PM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(7:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: there are actually students from EVERYWHERE
(7:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but it seems like the students that are not from neighboring countries don’t speak up in class
(7:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but I participated in all my classes today
(7:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and I dont think the Americans ever do
(7:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I’m in the process of becoming an estonian citizen 😂😂
(7:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Estonians are BIGGG post malone people
(7:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so there is a small % of my classes with native Estonians since they will probably take the same course in Estonian
(7:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: my classes are heavy in Russians, Italians, and Ukrainians
(7:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: the Russians and Estonians dont sit together
(7:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh yeah and LOTS of Turkish people
(7:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Estonians will pick anyone over Russians
