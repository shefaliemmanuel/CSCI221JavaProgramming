(5:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh hooking up with students?? lol yea
(5:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: diff setting
(5:33 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s rampant. And it’s always a disaster. 
(5:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Also in the business world.
(5:33 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s one of the most important lessons the kids could have drilled into their brains.....
(5:33 AM) Robert Seidl: .....and half of them will still end up doing it.
(5:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: everyone wanted to hu with our teams business mentor during the cohort 😂
(5:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh jeezzzzzz
(5:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he was basically an adult frat boy
(5:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: married might I add
(5:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Yup. Stories as old as time. 
(5:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: where are these stories I never hear them
(5:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Shefali you’re 20
(5:37 AM) Robert Seidl: And you thought making out was hooking up recently.....
(5:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: LEAVE ME ALONE hahahahahhahaha
(5:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol probably a few weeks ago this undergrad girl business student told me I should totally be a TA.... because according to her every undergrad girl would want to get with me essentially....
(5:41 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d rather get my balls chopped off than do that kind of thing. 
(5:42 AM) Robert Seidl: I think I’ve made it clear my quite strong feelings on not engaging in that kind of activity where you work. 
(5:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: well yeah that makes sense I think prob 25% of my TA’s have been un attractive if even
(5:43 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Its kinda normalized/ praised to be with your TA
(5:44 AM) Robert Seidl: But again, plenty of (male and female actually) TA’s / professors etc. are totally into that kind of thing. 
(5:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I would stay a STRONG majority
(5:45 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha ok I guess as a student I dated an older TA who was at the citadel 😂😂😂😂
(5:45 AM) Robert Seidl: But if I was a TA I’d never do that.
(5:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol………
(5:46 AM) Robert Seidl: I think I told you about that right? 
(5:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: one of my students spent thanksgiving with me
(5:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: last year
(5:46 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: no you didnt
(5:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh. I was a sophomore and she was a grad student at CofC
(5:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: AYEEEE
(5:47 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: a true cougar
(5:48 AM) Robert Seidl: Yes I did give her shit about that 😂
(5:48 AM) Robert Seidl: Dammit. Did it again. And don’t tell me it’s ok even if it is to you...
(5:48 AM) Robert Seidl: lol
(5:49 AM) Robert Seidl: Were you dating the student who spent thanksgiving with you? 
(5:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: of course not I wouldn’t want to get fired
(5:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Gotcha lol. I wouldn’t have looked down upon you... honestly it’s just that common / normalized to people (even if I don’t see how it could be so normalized)
(5:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: things almost happened after the semester but it was just too weird for me
(5:53 AM) Robert Seidl: Fuck I just realized what would I do if I had been YOUR TA.....
(5:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: what would you do??
(5:54 AM) Robert Seidl: I don’t think it’d be possible for us not to find ourselves vibing hardcore and relating to each other a shit ton....
(5:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Don’t think there’d be any way around it....
(5:56 AM) Robert Seidl: I absolutely wouldn’t hook up with you while I was your TA though.... even if I really wanted to and you tried to.... I’d still say we couldn’t.....
(5:56 AM) Robert Seidl: It’d not be easy... 
(5:57 AM) Robert Seidl: And I could easily see the tension building like fucking crazy...
(5:58 AM) Robert Seidl: I’d have to not be your TA anymore or a TA at the school at all... or you’d have to not be a student...
(5:58 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you wouldn’t have to worry about that I never have made a move on a TA , its the TA’s choice hahaha
(5:59 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha 
(6:00 AM) Robert Seidl: It’d be tough with us because the attraction would very likely be so fucking obvious. 
(6:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Part of the reason it’d be so tough is because it’d be more than just a “oh it’s hot because they’re cute and it’s this TA / student situation” kind of thing....
(6:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that sounds so bad ahahahah
(6:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: “it’s this TA / student situation”
(6:02 AM) Robert Seidl: I know. I get a headache just thinking about it. 
(6:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: prob 2 a sem lost their job for dating their student
(6:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: students sometimes
(6:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: cofc guys really dont care
(6:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Fuck no they wouldn’t. Shefali most people just don’t care.
(6:04 AM) Robert Seidl: Everybody’s fucking everyone and majority of them have marriages, significant others, improper business relationships etc. etc. going on
(6:06 AM) Robert Seidl: But also a lot of guys only try to date within their professional circles because they’re not the types that could just meet someone somewhere else. Plus they feel extra confidence they usually don’t have, due to the power dynamic often..
(6:09 AM) Robert Seidl: I like that you and I just happened to meet by chance. Neither one of us knew anything about the other at first, or was just raw attraction initially (which is a positive 😜) 
(6:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Not “or” ... *it
(6:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: @ Tilly
(6:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah I remember you mentioning that part in reference to Stuart and his son
(6:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: honestly me too
(6:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: there were no expectations
(6:11 AM) Robert Seidl: I had the opposite of expectations really and was extremely pleasantly surprised by someone so not basic (and I mean that just on a vibe level)
(6:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: couldn’t agree more
(6:13 AM) Robert Seidl: It just so HAPPENED that our social circles did somehow slightly intersect lol 
(6:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: thank god hahaha
(6:14 AM) Robert Seidl: I know. We both owe bracy a biggg thank you. Otherwise neither of us would’ve been as comfortable with pursuing visiting each other. 
(6:16 AM) Robert Seidl: I think this is usually where basic people say “everything happens for a reason” 😝😝😝
(6:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he doesn’t know how appreciated he is
(6:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: gross
(6:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂😂😂
(6:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Granted, I can’t help but sometimes feel like everything does happen for a reason... especially when confronted with things like this. It gets hard to counter it 😂
(6:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya he has no idea 😂😂😂
(6:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god hahaha someones feeling extra basic tonight
(6:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: speaking of which
(6:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: have you spoken to him
(6:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: should I ask?
(6:18 AM) Robert Seidl: I haven’t! Let me check if I have his number...
(6:19 AM) Robert Seidl: He’s in Charleston still right?
(6:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Atlanta
(6:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I’m pretty sure
(6:20 AM) Robert Seidl: Ah that’s right. Lol I’m going to call him and see how he’s been, (and probably make fun of you a bit 😝)
(6:21 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol that was a few phones ago... mind texting me his contact?
(6:21 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(6:22 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh and just messing with you I’d have a hard time speaking about you to anyone in any way other than overly glowingly probably 😂
(6:22 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahahahahaha the picture!!!!!!!
(6:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha idk how he put up with me
(6:23 AM) Robert Seidl: I do.
(6:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Dammit.... usually I would’ve taken that opportunity to say “I don’t either”
(6:23 AM) Robert Seidl: ....this isn’t good....
(6:24 AM) Robert Seidl: ..I’m getting soft..
(6:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahahaha this is great
(6:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not soft
(6:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just nice
(6:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: pleasant surprise 😂
(6:24 AM) Robert Seidl: I’M NOT NICE!!!!!
(6:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sorry
(6:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: youre a badass
(6:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: feel better now?
(6:25 AM) Robert Seidl: No, not what I was going for either!!
(6:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Just...
(6:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: well shit
(6:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Not “nice” 
(6:25 AM) Robert Seidl: 🤢
(6:26 AM) Robert Seidl: And “going for” isn’t the correct phraseology.... “not what I want to ever admit to myself” might be better
(6:28 AM) Robert Seidl: My immediate impulse when you said this is nice was to reply “yes this is” referring to you in general.. seriously someone needs to check my temperature...
(6:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 🤒
(6:29 AM) Robert Seidl: When you said *this is great*
(6:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha is this a new feeling for you
(6:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you seem horrified
(6:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: its hilarious
(6:29 AM) Robert Seidl: I am 
(6:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s
(6:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: perfect for spooky season 👻
(6:30 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m like that dog being dragged in to take a bath...
(6:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahahhahahahhahaha
(6:31 AM) Robert Seidl: And I can’t stop it. No matter how hard I fight it, the end result is getting soaking wet
(6:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Wait that doesn’t sound right 😂 I shouldn’t be the one linked to being soaking wet 😂😂😂
(6:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahahahhahah
(6:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: when I first read that I was very confused
(6:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 🐶💦
(6:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: im surprised their are not more dog emojis
(6:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: there
(6:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 🤯wait what is this lmao
(6:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 🤫not a fan
(6:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Mind blown? 
(6:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah ive never seen it before
(6:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Yup, I typed in mind blown and that literally was immediately recommended.
(6:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I wasn’t actually asking you what it meant lmao
(6:36 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂
(6:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I had just never seen it before
(6:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I see how my statement is flawed
(6:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sincerest of apologies
(6:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 👀
(6:37 AM) Robert Seidl: I just realized this might be more than I’ve texted... in a longggg time....
(6:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Now I’m going to be on a very late night run haha
(6:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh nooo lol
(6:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: shall I leave you to it
