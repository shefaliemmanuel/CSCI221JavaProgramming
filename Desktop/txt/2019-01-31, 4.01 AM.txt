(4:01 AM) Robert Seidl: Remember Dan Bongino who I was trying to show you a couple days ago? Today he did a must listen to episode for anyone who likes economics as it includes an extremely informative part on the economics of  healthcare. I think the rest of it is gold as well. Very curious what your thoughts would be on it.   Probably way too dense and full of facts and data for most people but I think you can handle it lol.

(6:51 AM) Robert Seidl: Today in Virginia - a baby can be killed after birth (in other words infanticide) admits the Virginia governor on pending legislation.
(6:51 AM) Robert Seidl: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UB_MZPTrbpU
(6:52 AM) Robert Seidl: This was a pro choice advocate’s response to what she thought about the killing of baby after it was born...
(6:52 AM) Robert Seidl: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3AZ_wiOjmHc
(6:52 AM) Robert Seidl: of a*
(7:01 AM) Robert Seidl: The legislation allows for anyone who feels their health could be effected negatively in any way to ask the dr. for the abortion.

Any time such wording has been made, courts allow for the women to subjectively determine what constitutes effecting her health with a dr. The effect is people having abortions whenever they choose as late as they want to. So when people try to frame it as the abortions would only happen in health situations, they are lying and hoping people won’t notice the actual effect of the legislation in reality. 
(7:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya and in NY they just passed a similar law with a bunch of people cheering wildly at its passing. 
(7:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Those leftists, they’re just so moral and compassionate. 
(7:06 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m honestly in disbelief 
(7:08 AM) Robert Seidl: When I hear someone talk like that lady was in the second video.... I hear someone who is the equivalent of a 1,000x worse than someone who thinks it’s cool to kick puppies for fun. 
(7:08 AM) Robert Seidl: Apologies for blowing up your phone really hope you weren’t trying to sleep 😬
(5:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hey sorry I just woke up- I took an antihistamine last night and it knocked me out haha 
(5:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: speaking of birth- Nikole snapped me last night while I was asleep and said if she is pregnant she’s going to keep the baby 
(5:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and followed up with even tho I don’t have the financial means to do so
(5:26 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Monica, I think is her name, IS BATSHIT CRAZY
(5:28 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that is crazy 
(5:28 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: after a child is delivered they are an individual human
(5:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she actually wouldn’t answer the question 
(6:30 PM) Robert Seidl: And the governor of Virginia who useddd to be considered a moderate literally casually spoke about the infanticide!!!! The way they dance around it tells me they know how bad it is but don’t care. They wouldn’t try so hard to dance around the question if they truly believed it wasn’t evil.
(6:30 PM) Robert Seidl: I think it’s like only 13% of Americans are even for abortions anywhere in the THIRD trimester....
(6:31 PM) Robert Seidl: And now “moderate” Dems are pushing infanticide.
(6:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Strange political flex but ok...
(6:32 PM) Robert Seidl: ——
(6:32 PM) Robert Seidl: Ya all you can do is be there for here then, it sounds like she hasn’t gotten her period.
(6:33 PM) Robert Seidl: Still doesn’t mean she’s pregnant as irregularities are extremely common to occur at least a few times over the course of any girls lifetime... but given her recent history...
(6:36 PM) Robert Seidl: My family law professor was just preaching to the class about the need for greater abortion rights 🤦‍♂️
(6:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah but spotting when you should be having your normal flow is SUPER common among pregnant women- typically means their would be complications in the future if one is tho 
(6:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: wowwwww
(6:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t think it’s anyone’s business besides the parents and doctors involved 
(6:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Almost everyone in the class seemed to be nodding their head in agreement 
(6:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: let them make their own decisions 
(6:38 PM) Robert Seidl: I exclamation marked it to show I’m responding to that.....
(6:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol okay 
(6:41 PM) Robert Seidl: But that’s EXACTLY how the democrats are framing it and getting away with it. Over and over they just repeat the decision is between a woman and her healthcare professionals but the way they wrote the law literally allows for ANYTHING. A baby already born is not just about a woman’s body and to say so is a flat out bait and switch LIE. (I personally believe 3rd trimester as well is undoubtedly a helpless infant that can’t defend itself)
lie
(6:41 PM) Robert Seidl: Remember they’re experts at putting pretty bows on terrible policy through the guise of...
(6:41 PM) Robert Seidl: Yo guessed it...
(6:41 PM) Robert Seidl: Compassion.
(6:43 PM) Robert Seidl: Murder of a born child, is not compassion. It’s evil you sick and twisted motherfuckers. I’m not even saying I personally condemn pro choice people in early terms is bad or evil people... but the line to any person with a little heart and common sense is clearly being crossed.
(6:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: my statement was in regards to before the baby has come out of its mother 
(6:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Right I understand. Personally I’m not for someone being able to just tell a dr. In the third trimester, “I think it might negatively effect my mental health” and get an abortion. At that point the baby is 100% viable and can live. It’s a helpless defenseless human being at that point, NOT a sack of tissue. If helpless and defenseless humans are sacs of tissue.... then ALL humans of any age are merely tissue sacs. A society that refuses to protect and allows for the murder of the helpless unborn, will allow for the mass genocide and murder of other helpless humans like those with special needs, the elderly or Alzheimer’s ridden, etc.... All of it, you know, “For the good of society”

Granny’s healthcare costs too much to our government run healthcare, and you know what... she doesn’t even really live that quality of a life anymore, and she’s a burden on those around her. She doesn’t even know where she is half of the time... so let’s just let nature take its course and not give her the expensive medical treatments to keep her alive. Let’s put her out of her misery. 
(6:52 PM) Robert Seidl: Add a state run healthcare system to the mix with such a society... and the rationing off of medical care for whoever society deems as “undesirables” becomes commonplace.
(6:52 PM) Robert Seidl: Don’t believe me, just look at every other authoritarian regime in human history that had state run healthcare and  deemed various classes of people as “undesirables”
(6:53 PM) Robert Seidl: It’s easy to stand up for the stronger or those who have a voice... it’s much more difficult and takes much more courage to stand up for those who have no voice. 
(6:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay I totally get what you’re saying and agree
(6:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’m about to go into yoga class 
(6:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: will respond after 
(6:55 PM) Robert Seidl: Haha k I’m walking into my next class as well 
(6:56 PM) Robert Seidl: Talk to you on the horny side of your post class! 
(6:56 PM) Robert Seidl: Whoops I mean, “Talk to you on the other side of your post class! 
(6:58 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha I’ve been so horny yesterday and today
(6:58 PM) Robert Seidl: Well then while you’re in your various yoga poses, just imagine me fucking the hell out of you in them 😉
(6:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol are you trying to kill me 
(6:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: okay I seriously have to go 
(6:59 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I love you have a good class

(8:34 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh don’t spend any extra time looking if they’re not right in your bag then I simply misplaced them!
(11:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I just ran into an old classmate who just had a kid and didn’t go to college 
(11:06 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: probably was one of the smartest guys I had ever met while I was in grade school
