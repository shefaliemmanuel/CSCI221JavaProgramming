(3:56 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha ok... I lava you too 
(4:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I LOVEDDD it 
(4:47 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: how’s your day been??
(5:01 PM) Robert Seidl: I wanted to send you some sort of “digital” valentine since you’re into that stuff. Probably would’ve been easier for me to just mail one 😂
(5:01 PM) Robert Seidl: It’s been great! 
(5:02 PM) Robert Seidl: Hope yours has as well! 
(5:04 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: A+++++
(5:04 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I was thinking about how long that could have taken you to make 🤓
(5:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so sweet
(5:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: mines been solid I got a new nickname! 
(5:05 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: “brave bachelor”
(6:25 PM) Robert Seidl: ?
(6:26 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol interesting
(8:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: shook this homework is actually insane 
(8:02 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and he said this is the easy one 
(8:25 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so it’s seems like this class is one that even masters students try to stay away from 
(8:25 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so he was saying i’m brave to attempt it as a bachelor’s student
(8:27 PM) Robert Seidl: If it’s too much don’t sacrifice your grade for it!!
(8:27 PM) Robert Seidl: And yes you are a brave bachelors student 
(8:28 PM) Robert Seidl: You should send me a pic of the homework 
(8:31 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol why 
(8:31 PM) Robert Seidl: I’m curious 
(8:32 PM) Robert Seidl: In my opinion you’re a BAMF
(8:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: haha okay I will send it when I get back home 
(8:34 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I just had to drop my bag off since everyone was waiting for me for our galentines day celebrations 😂🤓😋
(8:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: if i take this class in cofc I will get a bad grade
(8:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: this one is 70% homework and 30% final exam 
(8:36 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so he told the class to just do homework and you will pass
(8:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but the homework is insane 
(8:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so I kinda used one of the Ta’s the ENTIRE help session.....
(8:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Wait if it for a purely programming class maybe no need to send it to me 😂
(8:37 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s is purely programming 
(8:37 PM) Robert Seidl: Yup no that’s ok
(8:38 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s a russian teaching how to hack 
(8:38 PM) Robert Seidl: Why I got you that hat 
(8:38 PM) Robert Seidl: I’ll get you another that says BAMF
(8:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHAHA 
(8:39 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’re crazy 
(8:39 PM) Robert Seidl: No I’m not
(8:39 PM) Robert Seidl: I’m very proud of you 
(8:40 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: don’t be proud till I get my final grades back 
(8:40 PM) Robert Seidl: Regardless of what grades you get back 
(8:42 PM) Robert Seidl: Obviously grades are still great to get as high as possible... but they do not determine success. There’s plenty of book smart people who are dumb or lack guts. 
(8:43 PM) Robert Seidl: You will have continued success as long as you keep being you and growing. 
(8:44 PM) Robert Seidl: Believe me, I know people 😜
(8:46 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya, and if it wasn’t clear in the digital valentine.. “will you be my valentine?”
(8:46 PM) Robert Seidl: Actually no..
(8:46 PM) Robert Seidl: Fuck that.
(8:46 PM) Robert Seidl: You’re my valentine.
(8:47 PM) Robert Seidl: I don’t need to ask 😂
(10:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahhaha constant growth is the key to life 
(10:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: will you be my valentine??? 
(10:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😍😍😍
(10:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I couldn’t tell if you were asking or not this morning....
(10:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: didn’t know if I needed to look for one.....
(11:52 PM) Robert Seidl: I am your valentine 😉
(11:53 PM) Robert Seidl: I clearly withdrew my asking you to be mine because it you just ARE my valentine. 
(11:54 PM) Robert Seidl: I’ll never tell you what you can and can’t do.... that being said don’t even joke with me about that 😂
