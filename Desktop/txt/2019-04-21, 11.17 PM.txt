(11:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I was going to but it was during my teams meeting
(11:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was at 4pm
(11:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that was the only time today
(11:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: so weird
(11:22 PM) Robert Seidl: Listening to this clip of a JR podcast while making lunch.. have to send it to you because I’m pulling my hair out over this guest...
(11:23 PM) Robert Seidl: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAGdZKLMCc
(11:26 PM) Robert Seidl: Omg this guy is almost  as much of a monster as the puppy abandoner 
(11:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol I needed to keep track of my use of “umm” after hearing that
(11:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: why didn’t he just talk to an actual trans guy 
(11:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Joe? Because he has. Multiple times. 
(11:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: i mean Adam just keeps referring to them 
(11:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but if his whole deal is “we should ask them” then 
(11:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: joe says that he has in the video
(11:51 PM) Robert Seidl: Right... “my friends this, and my friends that” — purely anecdotal when there’s real studies that show the harm of the policies he’s aggrandizing.
(11:53 PM) Robert Seidl: His agenda once again comes from a misguided empathy... so misguided that he’s able to completely avoid the common sense that children are CHILDREN. 
(11:53 PM) Robert Seidl: If my kid thinks he’s Batman, that does not make him Batman... Adam.
(11:58 PM) Robert Seidl: You’re right. And notice how Adam is so focused on only talking about the people that gave him this opinion. NOT on the opinions of anyone whose opinion is different than his. 
(12:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he was telling joe “oh you’re talking about the outliers prob” but doesn’t back up his side at the same time
(12:01 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m fine with morons like this applying their idiotic ideology to grown adults. But start involving kids and you and I have major problems “Adumb”. 
(12:01 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i mean this is the same deal as the conversation about raising the drinking age
(12:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that is SO MUCH responsibility for an adult to freely give a child
(12:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: because “they feel like it”
(12:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: since when has that ever been a valid reason
(12:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol Adumb
(12:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Joe starts off the first couple minutes just laying out common sense logic and scientific facts. Adam simply responds, “I disagree.” 😂😂😂😂 Joe asks, “uh with what in particular do you disagree?” 
(12:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also how joe asked a straight forward question and adam was like “can you expand” and he was basically like what do you not understand 
(12:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s when I knew this was going to be a long podcast 😂
(12:04 AM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂 haha yah 
(12:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they never mentioned how costly this “feeling” is 
(12:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: on the parents 
(12:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Adam realized he was in over his head and also didn’t have the facts on his side as soon as joe started zeroing in on kids, so he then kept trying to back out of it with the whole “I’m not an expert” “I heard in studies but I don’t remember exactly” etc. etc.
(12:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: which could directly effect their child’s academic future 
(12:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it just made him sound super unqualified to discuss this subject 
(12:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: by saying those things 
(12:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Btw all kinds of transgender activists have pushed to try and get legislation passed that would make it illegal for a parent to keep their child from getting hormone replacement and transition treatment if they choose to..... that should tell you everything. They don’t care who their policies hurt, kill, or destroy. They simply want their agenda pushed at all costs. It is the pinnacle of evil to do evil under the false pretense of empathy. 
(12:10 AM) Robert Seidl: Your right it could effect EVERYTHING going forward in the child’s life!
(12:10 AM) Robert Seidl: It could destroy so many things. 
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: WHATTT
(12:12 AM) Robert Seidl: These people are insane shefali.
(12:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah I mean can you imagine what huge amount of debt this could bring for these individuals 
(12:13 AM) Robert Seidl: I used to think that it’s mean or cruel to ever question someone’s mental stability if they decide to be transgender.... but then I looked at the data from Doctors and psychologists, who laid out that many of them have DIAGNOSED mental disorders. 
(12:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it just seems like a new expensive (monthly subscription based) fad
(12:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I can’t deal with not being able to take out a loan for college all
because I had to take out. abunch to maintain my gender
(12:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: seems batshit 
(12:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Even if I was a transgender parent, under NO CIRCUMSTANCE we I ever be ok with my kid doing hormone therapy before he or she was a mature adult and made the decision with an adult brain. 
(12:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah but people could say these mental disorders are related to their emotional trauma they went through by being born into the wrong gender 
(12:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not agreeing ^ 
(12:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just saying what one could say to that
(12:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t know anything about hormone therapy, but it doesn’t sound stable 
(12:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Sure, I wouldn’t say that wasn’t part of it. But the studies showed that it’s not the majority. 
(12:18 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s not stable. It even effects everyone differently. And sure, if you have even me enough hormone therapy, I’d feel more like a girl too lol 
(12:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so what are you implying 
(12:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol yeah hormones are no joke but they should feel like that for a while before they start therapy in my opinion 
(12:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like be completely sure before they commit 
(12:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like having a kid
(12:22 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m absolutely implying that SOME (key word being some) of the people who are choosing to be transgender might be  doing so out of mental illness, attention seeking, depression, etc. I DO NOT go as far as some others to say that it would be more than “some”. 
(12:23 AM) Robert Seidl: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna996511
(12:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHA
(12:23 AM) Robert Seidl: And in the case of kids... they’re just F’ing KIDS! 
(12:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Read the article. Tell me if you notice any red flags in the first paragraph or so 😂
(12:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol if a male 3 year old told me he wasn’t a boy
(12:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i would just be like oh are you a unicorn 
(12:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: since when did transgender become an option 
(12:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: how would he/ she even know what it truly means 
(12:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they are 3 
(12:27 AM) Robert Seidl: They play both sides of it. “All transgender people always knew they were transgender and stuck in the wrong body.” AND “All people have the right to choose to be transgender.” 

Newsflash: THEY CAN’t BOTH BE TRUE.
(12:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol
(12:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Right! He’s fucking THREE YEARS OLD. 
(12:29 AM) Robert Seidl: One of mommies coked out celebrity friends was probably telling him “oh you’d make suck a cute little girl.” And the three year old the next day tells mom he’s a little girl. Mom, since she’s a GENIUS, just goes, ok! 
(12:29 AM) Robert Seidl: Such* not suck 
(12:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lolll
(12:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this entire debate is obscured 
(12:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: absurd
(12:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: *
(12:31 AM) Robert Seidl: Absolutely.
(12:32 AM) Robert Seidl: Can you imagine police knocking on you door to take your three year old away for hormone therapy because your three year old told the pre-school teacher that his parents wouldn’t let him be a girl? 
(12:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: oh my god
(12:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wild 
(12:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya..
(12:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Over my dead body 
(12:33 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: why should their be laws that interfere with these decisions 
(12:34 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s Marxism 101: separate the nuclear family and sow division, so that the State can become the new family and child rearers.
(12:37 AM) Robert Seidl: https://www.google.com/amp/s/fee.org/articles/5-things-marx-wanted-to-abolish-besides-private-property//amp
(12:42 AM) Robert Seidl: (Btw the other 4 are super interesting and I’m sure you’ll notice you may have heard me talk about them before lol) 
(12:46 AM) Robert Seidl: Btw I’ve read the Communist Manifesto by Marx and Engels 3 times.

(12:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and i’m unable to right now 
(12:50 AM) Robert Seidl: Well that’s awesome because it’s hard to find people who are  interested in dissecting and actually understanding Marx and Engels 😂
