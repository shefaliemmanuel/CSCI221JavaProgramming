(11:49 PM) Robert Seidl: I made it to the bow tie if that was the end

(11:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: next time you see me you know what to expect 😇
(11:52 PM) Robert Seidl: I have little to no understanding about how girl hair stuff works so not sure if the minds can quite meet 
(11:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: is this your way of telling me to send you more hair videos?? say no more 
(11:55 PM) Robert Seidl: All I can say is that when I get out of the Charleston airport and see you... that if you ran and tried to jump in my arms but I thought you looked too frightening... 
(11:55 PM) Robert Seidl: I’d drop you 
(11:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahahahah noted 
(11:56 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I hope you know that wouldn’t stop me tho

(12:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ahahah
(12:02 AM) Robert Seidl: Well even if you mess your face up I’ll still love your butt so after I dropped you I’d just calmly sit down on the floor with you, and grab your hiny.
