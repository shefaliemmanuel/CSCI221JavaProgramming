(3:08 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼omg would you possibly want this 😂😂😂

(3:27 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼I just died 
(8:14 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha I wouldn’t mind it if the purpose was altered: instead of it being a request of attention, I’d prefer for it to be a simple “I love you” like the three squeezes. 
(9:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahaha noted
(9:44 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we can make this happen if you have an apple watch 
(10:02 PM) Robert Seidl: I don’t have an Apple Watch obvi 😂
(10:03 PM) Robert Seidl: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wsCbLSqz85s
(10:03 PM) Robert Seidl: This. Was. Epic.
(10:07 PM) Robert Seidl: I’m sorry I don’t know how every single person isn’t utterly repulsed by the fact that these people hold office..
(10:09 PM) Robert Seidl: Not only are they liars, but they’re morons. 

It is fun to watch them own themselves though.
(10:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol Ninenke was like wow red hot passion 
(10:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you can have mine 
(10:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she wasn’t very professional the entire time 
(10:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: that kinda stuff still shocks me
(10:15 PM) Robert Seidl: Candace Owens wasn’t???
(10:15 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I didn’t think you could respond to a judge like that
(10:15 PM) Robert Seidl: 😂😂😂😂😂
(10:15 PM) Robert Seidl: Not a judge.... 
(10:16 PM) Robert Seidl: Congressman... 
(10:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he had a gavel thing 
(10:17 PM) Robert Seidl: And he just lied about her trying to make it seem like she endorsed hitler by using selective editing... and then tried to keep her from being able to even respond to his insult... 
(10:17 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I get that 
(10:20 PM) Robert Seidl: She was absolutely respectful. She simply stood up for herself and called them both out on their bullshit and the other guys lie. She better do that. You can’t bend over for people when they try to utterly destroy you with falsehoods. 
(10:22 PM) Robert Seidl: She’s a an African American trump supporter and has constantly been called in Uncle Tom, coon, the N word, and traitor by dozens of mainstream democrats and thousands of leftists who simply don’t believe an African American has can ever be sane and support Trump. So I ask, who are the the real racists?
(10:26 PM) Robert Seidl: She’s extremely dangerous to the left. That’s why she’s so hated and so attacked. If she wakes people up to how racist and fake the democrats are... they’re done. 
(10:26 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: yikessss
(10:29 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow, good for her!!
(10:30 PM) Robert Seidl: Your takeaway was that she was disrespectful? 
(10:30 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: initially, yes 
(10:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol I understand they do look like judges if you don’t know 
(10:32 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: Arguing + maybe judge = no bueno  
(10:32 PM) Robert Seidl: But if you’d like to see what disrespectful really looks like at Congressional hearings there’s hundreds of hours of video I could send you 😂
(10:33 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol she’s not on trial... she’s testifying as a citizen and a witness on a hate crime hearing...
(10:33 PM) Robert Seidl: Because she was the victim of a hate crime... from liberals....
(10:35 PM) Robert Seidl: She was in a restaurant eating and a mob of Antifa came in and started scream at her calling her a token N**, Nazi, and racist... and chased her out. They then called the restaurant racist for serving her 🤔🤔🤔🤔
(10:35 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: WHAT the actual fuck
(10:37 PM) Robert Seidl: This happens to her constantly. The point is to scare African Americans from supporting trump. Btw it’s backfiring... more African Americans are quietly starting to support trump than people realize. And they all say they get attacked with racist insults worse than they ever have in their life the second they say they support trump. 
(10:54 PM) Robert Seidl: Btw I have had a couple of African American friends who surprised me (since I knew they had always been democrat) and tell me they’re thinking about voting for trump (one even in the law school 😳). The law school friend told me that from our conversations she thought i might understand (even though she said she still had no clue where I was politically).. and they told me to please please not tell anybody lol.

(10:57 PM) Robert Seidl: Obvi don’t feel like you have to watch the whole thing or even any amount of it lol it’s long (I haven’t even watched it yet but will listen to some after class). Just wanted to send it to you for context.
(11:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: my roommate wants to run for office 
(11:18 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she is also asking for advice with emails and stuff
(11:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow she told me evan is scared of me 
(11:41 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂😂😂
(11:42 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: she fucked all of her friends in highschool out of pitty or because she felt like she owed it to them
(11:43 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: her not bf, bf is coming to Estonia.... she wanted advice on how to treat the situation since it’s a big deal because he’s using all of his air force leave for the year to come visit her 
(11:45 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhh i’m interested... I’ll watch a bit of it
