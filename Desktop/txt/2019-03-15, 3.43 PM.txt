(3:43 PM) Robert Seidl: As in fineeee
(3:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhh I was like lol okay thanks?
(4:14 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: have you ever been to Norway 
(4:15 PM) Robert Seidl: Nope
(4:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: shockingly enough it’s way cooler than the rest of eastern europe 😂
(4:16 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and we might go skiing 
(4:18 PM) Robert Seidl: Lol doesn’t surprise me, most other places in Europe are probably cooler in some ways than Eastern Europe.. (I think Poland and Hungary would be cool though)
(4:19 PM) Robert Seidl: Oh jeez haha be careful you don’t sign up for cross country skiing they take that shit very, very seriously there 
(4:19 PM) Robert Seidl: I’d be ostracized for showing up with a snowboard 
(4:20 PM) Robert Seidl: Snowboarders probably aren’t allowed most ski places there 
(4:20 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: POLAND IS STILL THE BEST 
(4:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we’ll see if this tops it 
(4:21 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: chubby thinks I was Hungarian in a past life 
(4:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: we don’t know if we have time or not 
(4:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but if we do we’ll try beginners 
(4:23 PM) Robert Seidl: Poland I’d guess would be 10x better 
(4:27 PM) Robert Seidl: If you haven’t been skiing before, you really won’t be able to do much of it at all in half a day... probably wouldn’t be worth it (You’d just gently glide down the baby bump and fall several times). But if you know how to, then feel free to disregard! (I think I remember you saying you might’ve tried it in North Carolina when you were little)
(4:31 PM) Robert Seidl: Have fun!
(6:20 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼￼
(6:20 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: thanks sweetsss
(3:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol chubby just asked if we knew who the modern day jukebox was
(6:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Googled it, now I remember lol 
(2:12 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼Viking Museum 
(11:58 PM) Robert Seidl: I would love that...
(11:59 PM) Robert Seidl: Pretty sure that’s the oldest Viking longboat ever found in that picture. 
(12:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Was preserved in a special natural bog and found in amazing condition. It’s the reason we know most of what we know about Longships.
(12:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you’re right it was AMAZING 
(12:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they have the largest one as well
(12:08 AM) Robert Seidl: That perfect boat you were looking was around over 1,000 years old
(12:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they didn’t have cute postcards at the viking museum so its coming from the Nobel Peace Prize Museum 
(12:09 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sorry I tried 
(12:09 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya the gostak or gostik ship or something..
(12:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this one if the Oseberg 
(12:11 AM) Robert Seidl: I know I’m saying the largest one is something that starts with a G I think.
(12:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: this is the G
(12:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Ah ok mixed them up then 
(12:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Gold tax 
(12:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Gokstad 
(12:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha I was close!
(12:13 AM) Robert Seidl: You wouldn’t even need a tour guide there I’d just be going ham 😂
(12:17 AM) Robert Seidl: Phhhh the Nobel peace prize is a politically motivated and biased joke. Obama got for no reason whatsoever... pretty sure it was in 2009 (before he had done jack shit) for “peaceful diplomatic efforts” lmao. 
(12:18 AM) Robert Seidl: The Nobel organization has always been like that they even tried to screw over and keep ignoring Einstein when he was coming up with amazing shit. Eventually they couldn’t ignore him because his theories were becoming so popular and had to give him the award. 
(12:21 AM) Robert Seidl: On the peace prize side they often give out the award simply for someone having made an agreement or treaty... not for the actual results of it (many cases where the results were epicly terrible) 
(12:23 AM) Robert Seidl: They even gave it to a US secretary of war who brutally stomped out the Philippine independence movement. 
(12:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh ya and Henry Kissinger has gotten one as well.... Henry Kissinger is basically The Godfather of the military industrial complex and perpetual wars 😂
(12:32 AM) Robert Seidl: (Triggers me a little of you can’t tell) lol 
(1:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lol that’s how chubby was 
(1:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he knew everything 
(1:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was his top priority here 
(1:41 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also all 3 of us are moving to Oslo upon graduation if you would like to join 😂
(1:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼greetings from your favorite backpackers 
(1:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wow I hadn’t noticed 
(1:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you seem triggered af 
(1:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but it was an interesting museum- def my favorite one in Oslo 
(1:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it takes SOOO LONG for someone to actually get the prize after multiple nominations 
(1:59 AM) Robert Seidl: The Nobel museum?
(1:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah 
(1:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it was designed really well
(1:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: very aesthetically pleasing 
(1:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and the exhibitions were amazing 
(2:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: some were stupid
(2:01 AM) Robert Seidl: My bone to pick is with the organizations itself. Not it’s museums aesthetics lol.
(2:02 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I gathered 
(2:03 AM) Robert Seidl: I’m sure the exhibits looked fabulous. To me they’d be like gold casings around garbage due to their “interpretation” of history 
(2:04 AM) Robert Seidl: (I’d still go for the record lol)
(2:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the theme was rape this year 
(2:04 AM) Robert Seidl: Really?!!!
(2:06 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: sarcasm?
(2:06 AM) Robert Seidl: I wonder, did they at all cover the astronomically higher rape incidents in their own country amongst Muslim migrants?  (Their media and police force itself will literally go out of their way to hide that shockingly high amounts of sexual assault are being done by Muslim migrants)
(2:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Same thing with Sweden 
(2:07 AM) Robert Seidl: The phrase “Stockholm syndrome” is oh so appropriate 
(2:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they actually did have a section on norway 
(2:10 AM) Robert Seidl: Did they honestly address the migrant sexual assaults?
(2:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not migrant sexual assault 
(2:10 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just general sexual assault 
(2:11 AM) Robert Seidl: Ahhh of course 
(2:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but they covered it all over the world 
(2:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: especially el salvador 
(2:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and different places in Africa 
(2:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: primarily 
(2:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: along with how it can be used in multiple wars 
(2:13 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼this was one of the main ones 

(2:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(2:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: snowden made it into all of this somehow 😂😂😂
(2:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Ahhh I thought it likely they’d focus in on South America and Africa... and generally avoid the Middle East. How much did they cover rape in all Muslim countries? (You can’t get accurate statistics from those countries... it’s just part of Sharia law for it to be ok for certain men to rape certain women, and if a married woman is raped the husband can beat her and sometimes even kill her) 
(2:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they had quite a bit on turkey 
(2:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: Egypt 
(2:17 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: pakistan 
(2:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I can’t remember which country but I remember reading that it’s legal to rape your wife in some places 
(2:18 AM) Robert Seidl: Nice! I’m glad they at least mentioned that.
(2:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: chubba was really depressed after reading everything 
(2:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I don’t think he had any idea this stuff happens as frequently as it does
(2:22 AM) Robert Seidl: You can’t have an honest discussion about sexual assault, rape, abuse, or women’s rights without addressing sharia law and how women are treated in many Muslim countries.
(2:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol if chubby really wants to get depressed he should research some evolutionary history on rape... and how it’s part of the fabric of human reproduction for thousands of years. 
(2:24 AM) Robert Seidl: Throughout history, rape is synonymous with war, conquest, and subjugation. 
(2:28 AM) Robert Seidl: How’d Snowden make it in to the museum?
(2:41 AM) Robert Seidl: How’s the food?
(5:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think he was thinking about everything from a fathers perspective 
(5:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: like if these things were to happen to his child
(5:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: there were other topics as well! 
(5:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(5:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the food was okay 
(5:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 10/10 would not try again
(5:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they have food of other cultures tho 
(5:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so their asian food is some of the best rated 
(5:25 AM) Robert Seidl: Ya. If I were him I’d be worried about the madre
(5:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so that’s what we ate apart from trying some traditional dishes 
(5:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the coffee WAS INSANE 
(5:26 AM) Robert Seidl: 1 bad parent can completely negate 1 good parent  
(5:27 AM) Robert Seidl: -1 + 1 = no parent 
(5:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so I think he also had a bit of his life dream shattered since his dream was to move to Oslo and you can’t really with a child 
(5:27 AM) Robert Seidl: Check out that math! 
(5:27 AM) Robert Seidl: 😢
(5:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: did you know alfred noble’s wife cheated on him with a mathematician so there are no prizes in the subject of math
(5:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha 
(5:28 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think it was a combo of that and the depressing facts 
(5:28 AM) Robert Seidl: No I didn’t! 
(5:29 AM) Robert Seidl: That’s fucking hilarious! 
(5:29 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: talk about petty 
(5:29 AM) Robert Seidl: Great info 
(5:29 AM) Robert Seidl: That should tell people EVERYTHING they need to know about how the organization as a whole!!!
(5:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: 😂😂😂 they don’t advertise it 
(5:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: or talk about it at the museum 
(5:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I was waiting the entire time they were talking about the history of the prize 
(5:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I was v disappointed 
(5:32 AM) Robert Seidl: Of course not. Just like they’ll never talk about all the negatives and discrediting things about their decisions and organization as a whole. 
(5:33 AM) Robert Seidl: Will all be tailored to be self aggrandizing of course. 
(5:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think it’s a cool facts 
(5:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: fact 
(5:36 AM) Robert Seidl: How can you not give a Nobel award for math the most fundamental aspect of modernity?!
(5:37 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he wanted to award people for practical inventions not theoretical 
(5:38 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha if the math is used in practical inventions and applications it’s not theoretical... at that point it IS PRACTICAL. What a joker.
(5:38 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ..... if that’s the case no one on economics should have one .......
(5:39 AM) Robert Seidl: And the way the peace prizes are awarded (as I outlined earlier) is inherently theoretical!!!!!!!!
(5:39 AM) Robert Seidl: Nobel was full of shit 
(5:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I like the nomination process specifically some one in the gov or past winner 😂
(5:40 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: because all people who are worth admitting interact with one of those?????????
(5:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahahaha EXACTLY!!!!!!!!
(5:42 AM) Robert Seidl: It’s nothing more than a giant circle jerk of good ol’ boys club where all the people in it are patting each other on the back telling each other what amazing and successful people they are. 
(5:42 AM) Robert Seidl: And plenty of people won’t speak up because they’re hoping they won’t ruin their chance of getting one in the future. 
(5:42 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: nobel didn’t give a fuck about anything he just felt guilty and this was a way to clear his conscience
(5:44 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh you bet 
(5:44 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s why all of their ideas and topics for the peace prize have traditionally steamed from war situations 
(5:44 AM) Robert Seidl: He was the “tradesman of death” by his own admission 
(5:47 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha oh the irony. His organization only continues his legacy of rewarding death when the supposed intent was to better life (the rode to hell is paved with good intentions) like when they award Maoist communists (who slaughter millions), war criminals, and guys like Kissinger.  
(5:49 AM) Robert Seidl: Also I’m assuming you’re referring to how Alfred was the one who invented dynamite and plenty of other mass death ballistics technology...
(5:49 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: lmao yes that’s exactly what I was referring to 
(5:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: also why does it have to take so long to reveal the nominations 
(5:50 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: PEOPLE DIE WITHIN 50 YEARS
(5:51 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: some people get nominated 85-90 times and will only get it on the 90th don’t you think there is some sort of hierarchy problem with the 5 Norwegians that determine the winners   
(5:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: clearly if 90 officials are willing to recommend someone they might be  worth it 
(5:52 AM) Robert Seidl: Can you imagine what most people would think if they knew the truth about things like this? Their brain would burst. If you walked up to the average person on the street and told them the inventor of the Nobel peace prize also invented a weapon that’s killed hundreds of millions of people (maybe billions), they wouldn’t believe you.
(5:52 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: idk a lot of it seemed like a stupid mind game 
(5:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s what he’s known for 
(5:53 AM) Robert Seidl: Truth is far stranger than fiction.
(5:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: do people not know that was his profession??
(5:53 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: where do they think he got all his fortune from 
(5:55 AM) Robert Seidl: Of course there’s a problem with the process! Its all A JOKE!! It’s all designed to come down to a centrally focused locus of power to make the decision... so the ‘chosen’ wise men can pick who they want at the end of the day. 
(5:56 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha, most people wouldn’t even have known there was an Alfred Nobel. 
(5:58 AM) Robert Seidl: They’d be like... I thought it was called the “Noble” peace prize because it’s given to people who are noble in the things they’ve done...
(5:59 AM) Robert Seidl: (To be fair that’s actually what I thought until I was at least 8 😂😂😂)
(5:59 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHAHA children get a free pass 
(6:00 AM) Robert Seidl: (In my defense it made logical sense)
(6:00 AM) Robert Seidl: Just like the sears tower being the “serious” tower 
(6:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: awhhhhhh little robby 
(6:00 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you were so cute 
(6:02 AM) Robert Seidl: My logic and reasoning worked against me. I think that’s a good lesson that no matter how logical we might think we’re being in something that our logic might actually be working against us if we’re not careful because it is always filtered by our perception. 
(6:03 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not what I wanna hear, but okay 
(6:03 AM) Robert Seidl: Little you and little I would’ve loved each other. I have no doubt.
(6:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahha 
(6:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we would been adorable 
(6:04 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: woulda*
(6:05 AM) Robert Seidl: We would’ve been like glue or magnets.
(6:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Things is we would’ve probably fallen dangerously in love at too early of an age. We would’ve been obsessed with each other. Our parents would’ve freaked out because they wouldn’t be able to get our minds off each other. 
(6:06 AM) Robert Seidl: Thing*
(6:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: might have been bad for personal development 
(6:07 AM) Robert Seidl: Agreed. 
(6:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wouldn’t know how to be alone
(6:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: and content 
(6:08 AM) Robert Seidl: Yup. I sure wouldn’t. 
(6:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: speaking of which 
(6:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(6:09 AM) Robert Seidl: What are your thoughts on that premise before I word vomit?
(6:11 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: on what premise 
(6:11 AM) Robert Seidl: The napkin 
(6:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: commence the word vomit 
(6:12 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha 
(6:12 AM) Robert Seidl: So you don’t agree with Mr. TNT?
(6:13 AM) Robert Seidl: (But, but, he’s so smart and has suchhhh a prestigious award named after him...)
(6:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: I think contentment if vital to self confidence which one could turn into a currency 
(6:14 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: but i’ve thought this for a while 
(6:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: the characteristic i’ve gotten since I was in first grade was contentment so it was more of a personal purchase 
(6:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you don’t tend to see many items that address it 
(6:16 AM) Robert Seidl: So you agree that “contentment is the only real wealth”
(6:16 AM) Robert Seidl: Oh hahaha and I’m not throwing shade at your purchase!!
(6:18 AM) Robert Seidl: So while you might appear to be someone who is content, you’re not really. You’re merely content with being not content. Similar to being comfortable with discomfort where others are not. 
(6:20 AM) Robert Seidl: A bit of a mind pretzel so feel free to tell me if I’m not articulating well enough... 

Most people are far too content. Far too comfortable. And therefore, all you see on them is discontent, and discomfort. 
(6:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: going through security!! gimme 10!
(6:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(6:23 AM) Robert Seidl: When I met you I could tell that you were someone who simply confidently embraced the chaos that you knew to exist around you. Your knew internally that through personal effort and discipline, that you could bring order to your own temple so to speak in the midst of any chaos. 
(6:23 AM) Robert Seidl: Haha k 
(6:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: feel
free yo keep typing 
(6:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ll just respond when i’m out
(6:26 AM) Robert Seidl: Hahaha no rush there’s never a need for you to immediately respond! 
(6:27 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(6:28 AM) Robert Seidl: How’s that for your contentment? 
(6:29 AM) Robert Seidl: Lol but on the phrase... I think it is incorrect.
(6:30 AM) Robert Seidl: It should be something more like “happiness is one of the greatest forms of wealth”
(6:35 AM) Robert Seidl: That phrase (“Nobel’s) is prone to lead people down the wrong road to just being apathetic or static. True contentment only ever comes through embracing and pushing through challenges and things that bring plenty of short term discontent. 
(6:37 AM) Robert Seidl: Part of what that statement also reveals is someone who chased and achieved vast sums of material wealth likely thinking it would bring contentment... but then realized it didn’t. And therefore deduced that the only real form of wealth is contentment. 
(6:40 AM) Robert Seidl: Btw as a side note I actually don’t think dynamite itself was an evil or bad invention... but probably a good one overall. (Just for the record). 
(6:42 AM) Robert Seidl: -much of modern development would not exist if not for dynamite. You can’t build anything worth while without first harnessing the power of wiping the slate or foundation clean. Cities, roads, etc. would not have been built like they were without dynamite.
(6:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(6:56 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: WHAT A GOOD BOY
(6:57 AM) Robert Seidl: That looks very good.
(6:57 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s bigger than my hand 
(6:57 AM) Robert Seidl: Too bad of the guten 
(7:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: even if you’re content with not being content you have made peace with it 
(7:07 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: so I think it’s a fair statement!
(7:08 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: he looks very content 
(7:08 AM) Robert Seidl: As long as there’s a healthy balance 
(7:09 AM) Robert Seidl: He looks sedated 
(7:09 AM) Robert Seidl: And there in lies the question... Winston... at what point is content, actually sedated?
(7:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: any powerful item developed can always be used for both sides 
(7:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: that’s part of the charm 
(7:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: there’s a fine line for everything 
(7:12 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: totally agree on the healthy balance 
(7:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Back in Estonia? 
(7:15 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: not quite 
(7:15 AM) Robert Seidl: Gotcha 
(7:16 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(7:17 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼I’ll get walking now.. and eventually swimming
(7:18 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: see you in T minus 1 year 😂
(7:19 AM) Robert Seidl: Ehhh probably 1.5
(7:19 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(7:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: by then i’ll be back in charleston 
(7:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just walk to king street 
(7:20 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we can meet up 😂
(7:21 AM) Robert Seidl: But... then you’d land in St. Louis 😂
(7:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼we found voldemort 

(7:22 AM) Robert Seidl: Scandinavians are freaking strange 
(7:22 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼tell me about it

(7:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we can swap places 
(7:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: i’ll hang out in st. louis you can chill on king streets 
(7:23 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: street
(7:23 AM) Robert Seidl: That would just be weird 
(7:24 AM) Robert Seidl: For you to be in St. Louis while I was in Charleston 
(7:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(7:24 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: yeah I wouldn’t know what to do lol
(7:24 AM) Robert Seidl: What the actual fuck 
(7:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: wait wait 
(7:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: there’s one more
(7:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: there were 500 of these sculptures 
(7:25 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: (don’t worry i didn’t take a picture of all of them)
(7:26 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(7:26 AM) Robert Seidl: This stuff looks demonic 
(7:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: it’s the famous angry baby
(7:27 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we just gathered that Norwegians are horny as fuck  
(7:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Kind of looks like Brian  Stelter 
(7:28 AM) Robert Seidl: Naw that’s just people.
(7:30 AM) Robert Seidl: The other one seemed like a post birth  abortionists favorite 
(7:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: they were all wild af 
(7:30 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: we were shocked 
(7:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: you would have loved walking through the park with us 
(7:31 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: just constantly dying of laughter and comments 
(7:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(7:32 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(7:34 AM) Robert Seidl: ￼
(7:34 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ohhhhfffff that eye 
(7:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: boarding!! 
(7:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(7:35 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: peep the snow 
(7:35 AM) Robert Seidl: Safe flight! Text when you land!
(7:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼
(7:36 AM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha I love it you’re such a little kid with snow... you still feel like snow is a winter wonderland.
(7:36 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahahah of course 
(9:55 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: landed
(10:45 AM) Shefali Emmanuel: ￼lol
(1:33 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: made it to Tartu!!
