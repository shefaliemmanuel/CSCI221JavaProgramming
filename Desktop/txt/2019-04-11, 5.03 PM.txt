(5:03 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ï¿¼
(6:22 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha 
(6:23 PM) Robert Seidl: Yaaa whoo knows ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
(6:23 PM) Robert Seidl: ðŸ˜œ
(8:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: HAHAHHA omg Arnis was messing around on my computer and my computer took all of my screens away and it was just my background (which is us) and iâ€™ve never seen a grown man get so awkward and try to get up and leave so fast 
(8:46 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he also might have been freaked out by the picture ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‹
(8:47 PM) Robert Seidl: Hahahaha 
(8:48 PM) Robert Seidl: Awee sounds like you broke his heart....
(8:48 PM) Robert Seidl: How..
(8:48 PM) Robert Seidl: Could you..
(8:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ï¿¼
(8:48 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: iâ€™m gonna go with it made him uncomfortable ðŸ˜‚
(8:49 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he was arguing with his wife earlier...so I donâ€™t think iâ€™m the one who broke his heart
(8:49 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahahaha nope definitely dashed his hopes 
(8:50 PM) Robert Seidl: Bahaha he mentioned his wife right away even as he walked his female student home to her very place remembaâ€™?
(8:50 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: lmao Iâ€™m still traumatizes 
(8:51 PM) Robert Seidl: I look terrible in that pic btw.. but I guess itâ€™s funny 
(8:51 PM) Robert Seidl: Yaaa 
(8:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: you canâ€™t just spring situations on me like that
(8:51 PM) Robert Seidl: This only serves as further confirmation of previous suspicion 
(8:51 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: well it was one from last time but sebastian decided to give me a mac background so this is the next one 
(8:51 PM) Robert Seidl: Which situation? Today or the walk home?
(8:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: walk home
(8:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: today was just hilarious
(8:52 PM) Robert Seidl: Wait, Iâ€™m kind of worried though....
(8:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: no
(8:52 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: why
(8:52 PM) Robert Seidl: I still want him to give you a really good grade...
(8:53 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: relaxxxxx
(8:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I have to earn the good grade
(8:54 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: this class is all numbers that heâ€™s not giving out
(9:00 PM) Robert Seidl: Ok.... so please listen very carefully to the nuance here hahaha.... 

As much as it pains me to suggest this (and obviously this is the polar opposite of what Iâ€™d want), IF you feel like later he still seems completely different with how heâ€™s interacting with you.. and IF you also think there might be a chance he could negatively influence your grade somehow.... and IF you feel like heâ€™s harmless and wouldnâ€™t get too overly excited and put you in a position you didnâ€™t want to be in â€”â€” then maybe just a tiny, tiny, more tiny, extra emphasis on tiny little bit drop a slight hint of what might be perceived as flirtation (like a couple extra smiles or something) just to keep him holding on to a slight hope that you might like him or something..... then I would understand.
(9:04 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: didnâ€™t see that coming 
(9:04 PM) Robert Seidl: I havenâ€™t met him obvi so I canâ€™t read it the way you can, but the only reason I say that is because thereâ€™s so many guys out there who will go from 1 to 110 when you least expect it  when it comes to what they see as their romantic life. Thereâ€™s a lot of weak insecure guys that get downright diabolical and vindictive the second some girl they had locked in on no longer seems like an option......
(9:05 PM) Robert Seidl: Remember the IFâ€™s hahaha there was a lot of nuance! 
(9:06 PM) Robert Seidl: The most important probably being the last one in reference to your safety....
(9:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: I appreciate it! However, I donâ€™t think this will be the case with him
(9:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: will def keep you posted
(9:07 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: but I think I would have sensed it since that happened at the beginning of lab
(9:08 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and he helped me after
(9:08 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: and sat next to me like normal
(9:08 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: ya know
(9:08 PM) Robert Seidl: Yes maybe not youâ€™re there and you have very smart intuition. That will be your best guide.
(9:08 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: donâ€™t worry about it! 
(9:08 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: iâ€™m good
(9:08 PM) Robert Seidl: Ahhh perfect
(9:08 PM) Robert Seidl: Silly me 
(9:08 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: omg
(9:09 PM) Robert Seidl: See I should have allowed more information to come out
(9:09 PM) Robert Seidl: Remember what I said about guys going from 1 to 110..
(9:09 PM) Robert Seidl: ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
(9:09 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: hahahaha yes
(9:09 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: he was so normal 
(9:10 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: (leaving wifi- will get it back in 15) 
(9:10 PM) Robert Seidl: Youâ€™re good! Iâ€™ll be in and out of class! 
(9:22 PM) Shefali Emmanuel: everything is closed idk what happened
